CD010270,"We identified nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria, including a Turkish study that is awaiting formal translation. There were 1244 participants randomised in classically designed RCTs, of whom 1197 had evaluable data, and 138 patients enrolled in an enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal (EERW) trial. Overall, 600 participants were treated with transdermal fentanyl patches, 382 with various formulations of morphine, 36 with methadone, and 221 with paracetamol plus codeine. There were major sources of potential bias, including lack of blinding, small size, high levels of attrition, and inconsistent reporting. We could not compare data in a meaningful analysis regarding adverse events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion. These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease process. There were insufficient comparable data for meta-analysis to be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat (NNT) for the analgesic effect. In seven studies with 461 participants reporting pain intensity results after about two weeks, the mean or median pain scores were on the borderline of mild and moderate pain. Most participants would have had no worse than mild pain on treatment. Another reported that 77% of participants using transdermal fentanyl had an undefined successful outcome. Fewer participants experienced constipation with transdermal fentanyl (28%) than with oral morphine (46%), giving a risk ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78); the NNT to prevent constipation was 5.5 (95% CI 3.8 to 10). The randomised trial literature for effectiveness of transdermal fentanyl is limited, but it is an important medicine. Most studies recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide data appropriate for meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many patients had good pain relief but, where data were reported, a majority had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time period. The evidence pointed to a useful and significant reduction in complaints about constipation for transdermal fentanyl compared with oral morphine.","We found nine studies involving 1244 patients. The studies were often small, used different study designs, and compared fentanyl with many different drugs. Most patients had pain that went from moderate or severe before transdermal fentanyl to no worse than mild pain when using transdermal fentanyl. Only 3 in 10 patients were constipated using transdermal fentanyl compared with 5 in 10 using oral morphine. We could not analyse the data in a meaningful way regarding harmful (adverse) events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion. These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease processes. The effect of the patch can continue after it has been taken off due to medicine that has been taken up by the skin. Used patches need to be disposed of carefully. We could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels – no worse than mild pain – so that patients with cancer are not bothered by pain."
CD011146,"We identified three RCTs including a total of 466 participants with a diagnosis of onchocerciasis. All trials compared doxycycline plus ivermectin versus ivermectin alone. One study investigated improvement in visual impairment at six-month follow-up; the other two studies measured microfilarial loads in skin snips to assess sustained effects of treatment at follow-up of 21 months or longer. The studies were conducted at various centers across three countries (Cameroon, Ghana, and Liberia). We judged all studies to be at overall high risk of bias because of inadequate randomization and lack of masking (one study), missing data (two studies), and selective outcome reporting (three studies). Only one study measured visual outcomes. This study reported uncertainty about the difference in the proportion of participants with improvement in visual impairment at six-month follow-up for doxycycline plus ivermectin compared with ivermectin alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.80 to 1.39; 240 participants; very low-quality evidence). No participant in either group showed improvement in optic atrophy, chorioretinitis, or sclerosing keratitis at six-month follow-up. More participants in the doxycycline plus ivermectin group than in the ivermectin alone group showed improvement in iridocyclitis (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.22) and punctate keratitis (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.00) at six-month follow-up; however, we graded these results as very low quality. Two studies reported that a six-week course of doxycycline may result in Wolbachia depletion and macrofilaricidal and sterilizing activities in female Onchocerca worms; however, no analysis was possible because data were missing and incomplete (graded evidence as very low quality). Adverse events were reported in 16 of 135 (12%) participants in one of these studies and included itching, headaches, body pains, and vertigo; no difference between treatment groups was reported for any adverse event. The second study reported that one (1.3%) participant in the doxycycline plus ivermectin group had bloody diarrhea after treatment was initiated. Available evidence on the effectiveness of doxycycline plus ivermectin compared with ivermectin alone in preventing and treating onchocerciasis is unclear. Limited evidence of very low quality from two studies indicates that a six-week course of doxycycline followed by ivermectin may result in more frequent macrofilaricidal and microfilaricidal activity and sterilization of female adult Onchocerca compared with ivermectin alone; however, effects on vision-related outcomes are uncertain. Future studies should consider the effectiveness of treatments in preventing visual acuity and visual field loss and their effects on anterior and posterior segment lesions, particularly chorioretinitis. These studies should report outcomes in a uniform and consistent manner at follow-up of three years or longer to allow detection of meaningful changes in vision-related outcomes.","As of 15 July 2015, we identified three randomized controlled trials. A total of 466 people with RB participated in the three trials. The trials were conducted in Cameroon, Ghana, and Liberia. In the Cameroon and Ghana trials, people with RB took doxycycline or placebo (sugar pills) for four weeks or six weeks. One dose of ivermectin was then given four or six months later. People were then followed for two to three years. In the trial from Liberia, people with RB were divided into two groups. One group was given doxycycline for 6 weeks followed by a single dose of ivermectin. The other group was given ivermectin alone. Both Liberian groups were followed up for six months. Evidence of the effect of adding doxycycline to the usual treatment of ivermectin for people with river blindness is unclear. Only one of the three trials looked at the vision of participants. This trial reported insufficient evidence to show a difference between treatment groups in the proportion of participants with visual improvement six months after the start of the study. Two trials showed reduced bacteria (Wolbachia) and fewer adult worms with combined doxycycline and ivermectin treatment than with ivermectin alone after about two years. However, new worms with the bacteria were found after treatment in one trial. Two trials reported adverse treatment effects in some participants; both reported no differences between treatment groups. One study reported that adverse treatment effects, including itching, fever, headache, body pain, and vertigo, occurred in 12% of study participants. The other study reported that one (1.3%) person had bloody diarrhea after starting treatment with doxycycline plus ivermectin, which stopped when treatment was withdrawn. We judged the overall quality of the evidence as very low because of methodological issues noted in the trials."
CD004291,"Fourteen unique trials with 1497 randomised participants were included. Antifungal prophylaxis did not reduce mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.44). In liver transplant recipients, a significant reduction in IFIs was demonstrated for fluconazole (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.57). Although less data were available for itraconazole and liposomal amphotericin B, indirect comparisons and one direct comparative trial suggested similar efficacy. Fluconazole prophylaxis did not significantly increase invasive infections or colonisation with fluconazole-resistant fungi. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, neither ketoconazole nor clotrimazole significantly reduced invasive infections. Overall, the strength and precision of comparisons however were limited by a paucity of data. For liver transplant recipients, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole significantly reduces the incidence of IFIs with no definite mortality benefit. Given a 10% incidence of IFI, 14 liver transplant recipients would require fluconazole prophylaxis to prevent one infection. In transplant centres where the incidence of IFIs is high, or in situations where the individual risk is great, antifungal prophylaxis should be considered.","This review found that fluconazole, used as a preventive drug, significantly reduced the number of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant patients. More studies are needed to determine how effective antifungal drugs are for pancreas, heart, kidney and lung transplant patients."
CD001096,"Twenty-eight studies (reporting a total of thirty-two comparisons) were included. Computer reminders achieved a median improvement in process adherence of 4.2% (interquartile range (IQR): 0.8% to 18.8%) across all reported process outcomes, 3.3% (IQR: 0.5% to 10.6%) for medication ordering, 3.8% (IQR: 0.5% to 6.6%) for vaccinations, and 3.8% (IQR: 0.4% to 16.3%) for test ordering. In a sensitivity analysis using the best outcome from each study, the median improvement was 5.6% (IQR: 2.0% to 19.2%) across all process measures and 6.2% (IQR: 3.0% to 28.0%) across measures of medication ordering. In the eight comparisons that reported dichotomous clinical endpoints, intervention patients experienced a median absolute improvement of 2.5% (IQR: 1.3% to 4.2%). Blood pressure was the most commonly reported clinical endpoint, with intervention patients experiencing a median reduction in their systolic blood pressure of 1.0 mmHg (IQR: 2.3 mmHg reduction to 2.0 mmHg increase). Point of care computer reminders generally achieve small to modest improvements in provider behaviour. A minority of interventions showed larger effects, but no specific reminder or contextual features were significantly associated with effect magnitude. Further research must identify design features and contextual factors consistently associated with larger improvements in provider behaviour if computer reminders are to succeed on more than a trial and error basis.","This review found 28 studies that evaluated the effects of different on-screen computer reminders. The studies tested reminders to prescribe specific medications, to warn about drug interactions, to provide vaccinations, or to order tests. The review found small to moderate benefits. The reminders improved physician practices by a median of 4%. In eight of the studies, patients' health improved by a median of 3%. Although some studies showed larger benefits than these median effects, no specific reminders or features of how they worked were consistently associated with these larger benefits. More research is needed to identify what types of reminders work and when."
CD009237,"We identified 34 RCTs with 3565 participants that met our inclusion criteria. All trials reported on conditions for tracheal intubation; seven trials with 846 participants described ‘events of upper airway discomfort or injury’, and 13 trials with 1308 participants reported on direct laryngoscopy. All trials used a parallel design. We identified 18 dose-finding studies that included more interventions or control groups or both. All trials except three included only American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I and II participants, 25 trials excluded participants with anticipated DTI, and obesity or overweight was an excluding factor in 13 studies. Eighteen trials used suxamethonium, and 18 trials used non-depolarizing NMBA. Trials with an overall low risk of bias reported significantly increased risk of DTI with no use of NMBA (random-effects model) (RR 13.27, 95% CI 8.19 to 21.49; P < 0.00001; 508 participants; four trials; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 1.9, I2 = 0%, D2 = 0%, GRADE = moderate). The TSA-adjusted CI for the RR was 1.85 to 95.04. Inclusion of all trials resulted in confirmation of results and of significantly increased risk of DTI when an NMBA was avoided (random-effects model) (RR 5.00, 95% CI 3.49 to 7.15; P < 0.00001; 3565 participants; 34 trials; NNTH = 6.3, I2 = 70%, D2 = 82%, GRADE = low). Again the cumulative z-curve crossed the TSA monitoring boundary, demonstrating harmful effects of avoiding NMBA on the proportion of DTI with minimal risk of random error. We categorized only one trial reporting on upper airway discomfort or injury as having overall low risk of bias. Inclusion of all trials revealed significant risk of upper airway discomfort or injury when an NMBA was avoided (random-effects model) (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74; P = 0.008; 846 participants; seven trials; NNTH = 9.1, I2 = 13%, GRADE = moderate). The TSA-adjusted CI for the RR was 1.00 to 1.85. None of these trials reported mortality. In terms of our secondary outcome 'difficult laryngoscopy', we categorized only one trial as having overall low risk of bias. All trials avoiding NMBA were significantly associated with difficult laryngoscopy (random-effects model) (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.21; P = 0.0003; 1308 participants; 13 trials; NNTH = 25.6, I2 = 0%, D2= 0%, GRADE = low); however, TSA showed that only 6% of the information size required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction (RRR) was accrued, and the trial sequential monitoring boundary was not crossed. This review supports that use of an NMBA may create the best conditions for tracheal intubation and may reduce the risk of upper airway discomfort or injury following tracheal intubation. Study results were characterized by indirectness, heterogeneity, and high or uncertain risk of bias concerning our primary outcome describing difficult tracheal intubation. Therefore, we categorized the GRADE classification of quality of evidence as moderate to low. In light of defined outcomes of individual included trials, our primary outcomes may not reflect a situation that many clinicians consider to be an actual difficult tracheal intubation by which the patient's life or health may be threatened.","We identified 34 randomized controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials included 3565 patients who were undergoing various surgical procedures in hospital departments. Most trials were conducted in high-income countries, and most patients were undergoing elective surgery. Trials included patients of both sexes; most were healthy and non-obese, and staff members did not expect difficulty when placing the tube in the windpipe. This review supports that use of NMBA may ensure the best conditions for placing a tube in the windpipe during general anaesthesia. When an NMBA is avoided, risk for pain or injury in the throat is increased following placement of a tube in the windpipe. Conditions for which a tube is placed in the windpipe are defined in individual trials and may not reflect a situation that many clinicians would consider to be clinically serious. Regarding events of injury and sore throat, only sparse data are available from trials with low risk of bias, although among all included trials, avoiding NMBA increased the risk of pain or injury. We therefore consider our overall findings to reflect evidence of moderate quality."
CD005556,"There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharitis and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior blepharitis (MGD). Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, comparisons, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the eyelid margin for anterior blepharitis. Lid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis. The effectiveness of other treatments for blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics, were inconclusive. Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.","This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis. There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in the review, 20 of which included participants with anterior blepharitis and 14 of which included participants with posterior blepharitis. For anterior blepharitis, topical antibiotics provided some symptomatic relief and were effective in clearing bacteria from the eyelid margins. There was no difference between the types of topical antibiotics used. Topical steroids also provided some symptomatic relief; however, they were ineffective in eliminating bacteria. Lid hygiene, including warm compresses and lid scrubs, showed some symptomatic relief in both anterior and posterior blepharitis. Overall, there was no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Further research should be done to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for blepharitis, with particular attention paid to adequate diagnosis and classification of the disease."
CD003519,"We included 46 trials with 3850 women and their infants; 38 trials with 3472 women and infants contributed data to our analyses. Trials took place in 21 countries, and most recruited small samples (just 12 trials randomized more than 100 women). Eight trials included women who had SSC after cesarean birth. All infants recruited to trials were healthy, and the majority were full term. Six trials studied late preterm infants (greater than 35 weeks' gestation). No included trial met all criteria for good quality with respect to methodology and reporting; no trial was successfully blinded, and all analyses were imprecise due to small sample size. Many analyses had statistical heterogeneity due to considerable differences between SSC and standard care control groups. Results for women
SSC women were more likely than women with standard contact to be breastfeeding at one to four months post birth, though there was some uncertainty in this estimate due to risks of bias in included trials (average risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.43; participants = 887; studies = 14; I² = 41%; GRADE: moderate quality). SSC women also breast fed their infants longer, though data were limited (mean difference (MD) 64 days, 95% CI 37.96 to 89.50; participants = 264; studies = six; GRADE:low quality); this result was from a sensitivity analysis excluding one trial contributing all of the heterogeneity in the primary analysis. SSC women were probably more likely to exclusively breast feed from hospital discharge to one month post birth and from six weeks to six months post birth, though both analyses had substantial heterogeneity (from discharge average RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49; participants = 711; studies = six; I² = 44%; GRADE: moderate quality; from six weeks average RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.90; participants = 640; studies = seven; I² = 62%; GRADE: moderate quality). Women in the SCC group had higher mean scores for breastfeeding effectiveness, with moderate heterogeneity (IBFAT (Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool) score MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.15; participants = 384; studies = four; I² = 41%). SSC infants were more likely to breast feed successfully during their first feed, with high heterogeneity (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.67; participants = 575; studies = five; I² = 85%). Results for infants
SSC infants had higher SCRIP (stability of the cardio-respiratory system) scores overall, suggesting better stabilization on three physiological parameters. However, there were few infants, and the clinical significance of the test was unclear because trialists reported averages of multiple time points (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; participants = 81; studies = two; GRADE low quality). SSC infants had higher blood glucose levels (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; participants = 144; studies = three; GRADE: low quality), but similar temperature to infants in standard care (MD 0.30 degree Celcius (°C) 95% CI 0.13 °C to 0.47 °C; participants = 558; studies = six; I² = 88%; GRADE: low quality). Women and infants after cesarean birth
Women practicing SSC after cesarean birth were probably more likely to breast feed one to four months post birth and to breast feed successfully (IBFAT score), but analyses were based on just two trials and few women. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether SSC could improve breastfeeding at other times after cesarean. Single trials contributed to infant respiratory rate, maternal pain and maternal state anxiety with no power to detect group differences. Subgroups
We found no differences for any outcome when we compared times of initiation (immediate less than 10 minutes post birth versus early 10 minutes or more post birth) or lengths of contact time (60 minutes or less contact versus more than 60 minutes contact). Evidence supports the use of SSC to promote breastfeeding. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm physiological benefit for infants during transition to extra-uterine life and to establish possible dose-response effects and optimal initiation time. Methodological quality of trials remains problematic, and small trials reporting different outcomes with different scales and limited data limit our confidence in the benefits of SSC for infants. Our review included only healthy infants, which limits the range of physiological parameters observed and makes their interpretation difficult.","We searched for randomized controlled studies of immediate and early SSC on 17 December 2015. We found thirty-eight studies with 3472 women that provided data for analysis. Most studies compared early SSC with standard hospital care for women with healthy full-term babies. In eight studies women gave birth by cesarean, and in six studies the babies were healthy but born preterm at 35 weeks or more. More women who had SSC with their babies were still breastfeeding at one to four months after giving birth (14 studies, 887 women, moderate-quality evidence). Mothers who had SSC breast fed their infants longer, too, on average over 60 days longer (six studies, 264 women, low-quality evidence). Babies held in SSC were more likely to have breast fed successfully during their first breast feed (five studies, 575 women). Babies held in SSC had higher blood glucose levels (three studies, 144 women, low-quality evidence), but similar temperature to babies with standard care (six studies, 558 women, low-quality evidence). We had too few babies in our included studies and the quality of the evidence was too low for us to be very confident in the results for infants. Women giving birth by cesarean may benefit from early SSC, with more women breastfeeding successfully and still breastfeeding at one to four months (fourteen studies, 887 women, moderate-quality evidence), but there were not enough women studied for us to be confident in this result. We found no clear benefit to immediate SSC rather than SSC after the baby had been washed and examined. Neither did we find any clear advantage of a longer duration of SSC (more than one hour) compared with less than one hour. Future trials with more women and infants may help us answer these questions with confidence. SSC was defined in various ways and different scales and times were used to measure different outcomes. Women and staff knew they were being studied, and women in the standard care groups had varying levels of breastfeeding support. These differences lead to wide variation in the findings and a lower quality evidence. Many studies were small with less than 100 women participating. The evidence from this updated review supports using immediate or early SSC to promote breastfeeding. This is important because we know breastfeeding helps babies avoid illness and stay healthy. Women giving birth by cesarean may benefit from early SSC but we need more studies to confirm this. We still do not know whether early SSC for healthy infants helps them make the transition to the outside world more smoothly after birth, but future good quality studies may improve our understanding. Despite our concerns about the quality of the studies, and since we found no evidence of harm in any included studies, we conclude the evidence supports that early SSC should be normal practice for healthy newborns including those born by cesarean and babies born early at 35 weeks or more."
CD011860,"We included nine studies—four CRCTs, three RCTs, and two CBAs—with a total of 1688 participants. Five studies reported episodes of aggression, and six studies reported secondary outcomes. Seven studies were conducted among nurses or nurse aides, and two studies among healthcare workers in general. Three studies took place in long-term care, two in the psychiatric ward, and four in hospitals or health centers. Studies were reported from the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, and Sweden. All included studies reported on education combined with training interventions. Four studies evaluated online programs, and five evaluated face-to-face programs. Five studies were of long duration (up to 52 weeks), and four studies were of short duration. Eight studies had short-term follow-up (< 3 months), and one study long-term follow-up (> 1 year). Seven studies were rated as being at ""high"" risk of bias in multiple domains, and all had ""unclear"" risk of bias in a single domain or in multiple domains. Effects on aggression
Short-term follow-up
The evidence is very uncertain about effects of education and training on aggression at short-term follow-up compared to no intervention (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.27 to 0.61, 2 CRCTs; risk ratio [RR] 2.30, 95% CI 0.97 to 5.42, 1 CBA; SMD -1.24, 95% CI -2.16 to -0.33, 1 CBA; very low-certainty evidence). Long-term follow-up
Education may not reduce aggression compared to no intervention in the long term (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37, 1 CRCT; low-certainty evidence). Effects on knowledge, attitudes, skills, and adverse outcomes
Education may increase personal knowledge about workplace aggression at short-term follow-up (SMD 0.86, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.38, 1 RCT; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about effects of education on personal knowledge in the long term (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.75, 1 RCT; very low-certainty evidence). Education may improve attitudes among healthcare workers at short-term follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.94, 2 CRCTs and 3 RCTs; very low-certainty evidence). The type and duration of interventions resulted in different sizes of effects. Education may not have an effect on skills related to workplace aggression (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.49, 1 RCT and 1 CRCT; very low-certainty evidence) nor on adverse personal outcomes, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.40, 1 RCT; very low-certainty evidence). Measurements of these concepts showed high heterogeneity. Education combined with training may not have an effect on workplace aggression directed toward healthcare workers, even though education and training may increase personal knowledge and positive attitudes. Better quality studies that focus on specific settings of healthcare work where exposure to patient aggression is high are needed. Moreover, as most studies have assessed episodes of aggression toward nurses, future studies should include other types of healthcare workers who are also victims of aggression in the same settings, such as orderlies (healthcare assistants). Studies should especially use reports of aggression at an institutional level and should rely on multi-source data while relying on validated measures. Studies should also include days lost to sick leave and employee turnover and should measure outcomes at one-year follow-up. Studies should specify the duration and type of delivery of education and should use an active comparison to prevent raising awareness and reporting in the intervention group only.","We found nine studies including 1688 healthcare workers (including healthcare support staff, such as receptionists) who worked with patients and patients' families, friends, and carers. These studies compared the effects of receiving an education and training program to the effects of not receiving such a program. Studies were conducted in hospitals or healthcare centers (four studies), in psychiatric wards (two studies), and in long-term care centers (three studies) in the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Taiwan. All programs combined education with training provided either online (four studies) or face-to-face (five studies). In eight studies, the people taking part were followed for up to three months (short-term), and in one study for over one year (long-term). Education and training programs did not reduce the number of reports of aggressive behavior toward healthcare workers (five studies), possibly because these programs made healthcare workers more likely to report these incidents. An education and training program might improve healthcare workers’ knowledge of aggressive behavior in the workplace in the short term (one study), but we are uncertain whether this would be a long-term effect (one study). Education programs might improve healthcare workers' attitudes toward aggressive behavior in the short term (five studies), although these results varied depending on the type and length of the program provided. Education programs might not affect healthcare workers' skills in dealing with aggressive behavior (two studies) and might not affect whether unwanted or negative personal effects were noted after healthcare workers experienced aggressive behavior (one study). We are not confident in the results of our review because these results were reported from a small number of studies—some with small numbers of participants—and because some studies showed large differences in results. We identified problems involving the ways some studies were designed, conducted, and reported. Our results are likely to change if further evidence should become available. Although an education and training program might increase healthcare workers' knowledge and positive attitudes, such a program might not affect the number of incidents of aggressive behavior that healthcare workers experience. More studies are needed, particularly in healthcare workplaces with high rates of aggressive behavior."
CD001530,"A total of 11 trials were included. Seven trials addressed the timing of support (early versus delayed), data on mortality were obtained for all seven trials (284 participants). The relative risk (RR) for death with early nutritional support was 0.67 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.07). Data on disability were available for three trials. The RR for death or disability at the end of follow-up was 0.75 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.11). Seven trials compared parenteral versus enteral nutrition. Because early support often involves parenteral nutrition, three of the trials are also included in the previous analyses. Five trials (207 participants) reported mortality. The RR for mortality at the end of follow-up period was 0.66 (0.41 to 1.07). Two trials provided data on death and disability. The RR was 0.69 (95% Cl 0.40 to 1.19). One trial compared gastric versus jejunal enteral nutrition, there were no deaths and the RR was not estimable. This review suggests that early feeding may be associated with a trend towards better outcomes in terms of survival and disability. Further trials are required. These trials should report not only nutritional outcomes but also the effect on death and disability.","The authors identified 11 eligible trials that investigated the timing and route of nutritional support in head-injured patients. These trials included a total of 534 patients. However, of the many of the trials had methodological weaknesses. The authors found that early feeding may be associated with fewer infections and a trend towards better outcomes in terms of survival and disability. However, the trials were small so any improvements detected were on a small scale. Also the focus of many of the trials was on nutritional outcomes, and many did not report the effect on death and disability. The authors were unable to obtain data for death and disability for all of the included trials so they feel there may be a possibility of bias. Further trials of nutritional support following head injury are required. These trials should report death and disability as well nutritional outcomes. They should also be large enough to detect clinically important treatment effects."
CD003833,"Nine studies were included representing 425 participants. All studies compared omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with placebo lasting from four weeks to two years. Three studies with long treatment periods administered additional substances, making any observed effects impossible to attribute to omega-3 fatty acids and were excluded from the statistical analyses. One study did not express any mean values and, therefore, could not be included in statistical analyses. No significant differences between intervention and control groups were observed in pain-free walking distance (mean difference (MD) 11.62 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -67.74 to 90.98), maximal walking distance (MD 16.99 m, 95% CI -72.14 to 106.11), ankle brachial pressure index (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.05), total cholesterol levels (MD 0.27 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to 1.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (MD 0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.15), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (MD 0.44 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.31 to 1.19), triglyceride levels (MD -0.39 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.33), systolic blood pressure (MD 5.00 mmHg, 95% CI -11.59 to 21.59) or plasma viscosity (MD 0.03 mPa/s, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.08). There was some limited evidence that blood but not plasma viscosity levels decreased with treatment and gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence were observed in two studies. Omega-3 fatty acids appear to have little haematological benefit in people with intermittent claudication and there is no evidence of consistently improved clinical outcomes (quality of life, walking distance, ankle brachial pressure index or angiographic findings). Supplementation may also cause adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence. Further research is needed to evaluate fully short- and long-term effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the most clinically relevant outcomes in people with intermittent claudication before they can be recommended for routine use.","The review included nine randomised controlled trials with 425 participants, comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with other fatty acids. On the basis of these studies, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not improve walking distance, blood pressure in the leg or any other measure of clinical benefit. There was some limited evidence to suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may reduce blood viscosity (the resistance of blood to flow), which when high could potentially contribute to intermittent claudication. There was no evidence to suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduced plasma (the liquid component of blood) viscosity or improved the levels of different types of cholesterol or any other components of blood tested. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence were observed in two studies."
CD006466,"Of 12,620 identified citations, 10 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The oral anticoagulant was a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in six of these RCTs, and a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in the remaining four RCTs (three studies used apixaban; one used rivaroxaban). The comparator was either placebo or no prophylaxis. Compared to no prophylaxis, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) probably reduce mortality at six months slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 72 fewer to 41 more; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably reduce mortality at 12 months slightly (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 75 fewer to 17 more; moderate-certainty evidence). One study assessed the effect of a VKA compared to no prophylaxis on thrombosis; the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of VKA compared to no VKA on pulmonary embolism and symptomatic DVT (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.58; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 98 more; very low-certainty evidence; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.42; RD 35 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 37 fewer to 16 more; very low-certainty evidence, respectively). Also, VKAs probably increase major and minor bleeding at 12 months (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.86 to 4.62; RD 107 more per 1000, 95% CI 48 more to 201 more; moderate-certainty evidence for major bleeding, and RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.32; RD 167 more per 1000, 95% CI 66 more to 337 more; moderate-certainty evidence for minor bleeding). Compared to no prophylaxis, at three to six months, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) probably reduce mortality slightly (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.38, RD 11 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 67 fewer to 70 more; moderate-certainty evidence), probably reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism slightly compared to no prophylaxis (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.98; RD 24 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 1 fewer; moderate-certainty evidence), probably reduce symptomatic DVT slightly (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.15; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 8 more; moderate-certainty evidence), probably do not increase major bleeding (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.80; RD 9 more per 1000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 40 more; moderate-certainty evidence), and may increase minor bleeding (RR 3.58, 95% CI 0.55 to 23.44; RD 55 more per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 482 more; low-certainty evidence). In ambulatory people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy (either alone or in combination), the current evidence on VKA thromboprophylaxis suggests that the harm of major bleeding might outweigh the benefit of reduction in venous thromboembolism. With DOACs, the benefit of reduction in venous thromboembolic events outweighs the risk of major bleeding. Editorial note: this is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence, as it becomes available.

We focused on people with cancer who were not admitted to hospital for their cancer treatment. We were interested in the effects of blood thinners on:
- death;
- formation of blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism). Venous thromboembolism includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) where a clot lodges in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis, and pulmonary embolism where a clot lodges in the lungs;
- major and minor bleeding. We searched for studies that examined the benefits and harms of blood thinners for people being treated for cancer who otherwise had no signs, symptoms or conditions that suggested blood thinning was definitely needed. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 10 studies that involved 2934 people with cancer. The biggest study had 841 people and the smallest had 24 people. The studies used two types of blood thinner:
- the vitamin K antagonist, warfarin; or
- direct [ER1] oral anticoagulants (specifically, apixaban and rivaroxaban). Compared to no preventative treatment, warfarin, the vitamin K antagonist medicine:
- probably reduces death at 6 months and at 12 months slightly (22 and 29 fewer deaths, respectively, per 1000 people);
- may have little to no effect on formation of blood clots, but we are very uncertain about the results;
- probably increases major bleeding and minor bleeding at 12 months (107 more major bleeds and 167 more minor bleeds per 1000 people). Compared to no preventative treatment, direct oral anticoagulant medicines:
- probably reduce death at 3 to 6 months slightly (11 fewer deaths per 1000 people);
- probably reduce blood clots in the lungs and legs slightly (24 fewer in the lungs and 19 fewer in the legs per 1000 people);
- probably do not increase major bleeding (9 more major bleeds per 1000 people);
- may increase minor bleeding (55 more minor bleeds per 1000 people). 
with a vitamin K antagonist, the risk of major bleeding might outweigh the benefit of any reduction in the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs;
with direct oral anticoagulants, the benefit of reduction in the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs outweighs the risk of major bleeding. We are moderately confident in the evidence for death, major bleeding and minor bleeding. In eight of the studies, the methods used may have affected the results. We are not confident in the evidence for blood clots in people who were given vitamin K antagonist medicine because the evidence came from one study only. This study gave the medicine in a fixed rather than variable dose, which is not current best practice. This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2021. Editorial note: this is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

CD003204,"We found six prospective controlled trials relating to our question. Four of these were described as randomised controlled trials, one was a prospective controlled trial that did not specify allocation to comparison groups, and one was a repeated cross-sectional study comparing different interventions. Comparison interventions included non-iodised salt, iodised water, iodised oil, and salt iodisation with potassium iodide versus potassium iodate. Numbers of participants in the trials ranged from 35 to 334; over 20,000 people were included in the cross-sectional study. Three studies were in children only, two investigated both groups of children and adults and one investigated pregnant women. There was a tendency towards goitre reduction with iodised salt, although this was not significant in all studies. There was also an improved iodine status in most studies (except in small children in one of the studies), although urinary iodine excretion did not always reach the levels recommended by the WHO. None of the studies observed any adverse effects of iodised salt. The results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status. No conclusions can be made about improvements in other, more patient-oriented outcomes, such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address questions of dosage and best means of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings.","This review looked at studies of iodised salt in the diet that included a comparison group. Six studies, most of them in children but some also in adults, were included. Iodine in the urine increased in all but one studies, but there was some concern that small children did not eat enough salt to achieve adequate iodine status. Some studies, but not all, also showed a reduction in the enlargement of the thyroid gland (goitre) that can accompany lack of iodine in the diet. Adverse effects were not reported, but these may not have been studied adequately. More high quality long term studies measuring outcomes related to child development, to deaths associated with iodine-deficiency and to adverse effects are needed."
CD006233,"We included 5 randomised trials with 662 participants out of 93 publications identified through the literature searches. The number of deaths was 47 in the wait-and-see group (334 patients) compared to 26 in the prophylactic cholecystectomy group (328 patients) for a 78% increased risk of mortality (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.75, P = 0.010). The survival benefit of prophylactic cholecystectomy was independent of trial design, inclusion of high risk patients or inclusion of any one of the five trials. Patients in the wait-and-see group had higher rates of recurrent biliary pain (RR 14.56, 95% CI 4.95 to 42.78, P < 00001), jaundice or cholangitis (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.87, P = 0.03), and of repeat ERCP or other forms of cholangiography (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.32, P = 0.005). Cholecystectomy was eventually performed in 35% (115 patients) of the wait-and-see group. Prophylactic cholecystectomy should be offered to patients whose gallbladders remain in-situ after endoscopic sphincterotomy and common bile duct clearance.","We included 5 randomised trials with 662 participants out of 93 publications identified through the literature searches. The number of deaths was 47 in the wait-and-see group (334 patients) compared with 26 in the prophylactic cholecystectomy group (328 patients). This review of randomised clinical trials suggests that early removal of the gallbladder decreases the risk of death or of complications from gallstones. The number of patients (662) reviewed in this report prevents some of the subgroup analyses from being conclusive. Further clinical trials, particularly of high-risk patients, would solve this problem."
CD003315,"Five RCTs with a total of 292 babies, were included in the review. Comparisons made within the RCTs were squeezable versus rigid feeding bottles (two studies), breastfeeding versus spoon-feeding (one study) and maxillary plate versus no plate (two studies). No statistically significant differences were shown for any of the primary outcomes when comparing bottle types, although squeezable bottles were less likely to require modification. No difference was shown for infants fitted with a maxillary plate compared to no plate. However, there was some evidence of an effect on weight at 6 weeks post-surgery in favour of breastfeeding when compared to spoon-feeding (mean difference 0.47; 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.74). Squeezable bottles appear easier to use than rigid feeding bottles for babies born with clefts of the lip and/or palate, however, there is no evidence of a difference in growth outcomes between the bottle types. There is weak evidence that breastfeeding is better than spoon-feeding following surgery for cleft. There was no evidence to suggest that maxillary plates assist growth in babies with clefts of the palate. No evidence was found to assess the use of any types of maternal advice and/or support for these babies.","Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon-feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon-feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate."
CD006258,"Twenty studies comprising 667 participants were included in the 2006 review. In that review, there was insufficient evidence of treatment effects on major clinical outcomes to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. Searching to February 2015 identified 40 eligible studies comprising 3483 participants overall. In total, 35 studies (4039 participants) compared HF, HDF or AFB with HD, three studies (54 participants) compared AFB with HDF, and three studies (129 participants) compared HDF with HF. Risks of bias in all studies were generally high resulting in low confidence in estimated treatment effects. Convective dialysis had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (11 studies, 3396 participants: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.05; I2 = 34%), but significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality (6 studies, 2889 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; I2 = 0%). One study reported no significant effect on rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events (714 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.50) and two studies showed no significant difference in hospitalisation (2 studies, 1688 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.63; I2 = 0%). One study reported rates of hypotension during dialysis were significantly reduced with convective therapy (906 participants: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.80). Adverse events were not systematically evaluated in most studies and data for health-related quality of life were sparse. Convective therapies significantly reduced predialysis levels of B2 microglobulin (12 studies, 1813 participants: MD -5.55 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.11 to -1.98; I2 = 94%) and increased dialysis dose (Kt/V urea) (14 studies, 2022 participants: MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.14; I2 = 90%) compared to diffusive therapy, but results across studies were very heterogeneous. Sensitivity analyses limited to studies comparing HDF with HD showed very similar results. Directly comparative data for differing types of convective dialysis were insufficient to draw conclusions. Studies had important risks of bias leading to low confidence in the summary estimates and were generally limited to patients who had adequate dialysis vascular access. Convective dialysis may reduce cardiovascular but not all-cause mortality and effects on nonfatal cardiovascular events and hospitalisation are inconclusive. However, any treatment benefits of convective dialysis on all patient outcomes including cardiovascular death are unreliable due to limitations in study methods and reporting. Future studies which assess treatment effects of convection dose on patient outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular events would be informative.","We identified 40 studies enrolling 4137 adult participants. Of these, 35 studies in 4039 adults compared convective dialysis with standard haemodialysis. Overall the evidence in the studies was low or very low quality due to limitations in the methods used in the research leading to low confidence in the results. Overall, there was no evidence convective dialysis lowered risk of death from any cause but may reduce death due to heart or vascular disease. Overall treating 1000 men and women who have end-stage kidney disease with convective dialysis rather than standard haemodialysis may prevent 25 dying from heart disease. Convective therapy may reduce blood pressure falls during dialysis but there was no evidence that convective dialysis influenced chances of hospital admission or other side-effects, or improved quality of life."
CD010829,"Our search strategy identified 46 studies (47 primary articles, including one abstract) comprising 24 parallel RCTs, 19 cluster RCTs and 3 quasi-RCTs. Sample sizes ranged from 138 to 1,085,292 (median = 514). A total of 16 studies measured registration behaviour, 27 measured intention to register/donate and three studies measured both registration behaviour and intention to register. Interventions were delivered in a variety of different settings: schools (14 studies), driver’s motor vehicle (DMV) centres (5), mail-outs (4), primary care centres (3), workplaces (1), community settings (7) and general public (12). Interventions were highly varied in terms of their content and included strategies such as educational sessions and videos, leveraging peer leaders, staff training, message framing, and priming. Most studies were rated as having high or unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment and low risk for the remainder of the domains. Data from 34/46 studies (74%) were available for meta-analysis. Low certainty evidence showed organ donation registration interventions had a small overall effect on improving registration behaviour (16 studies, 1,294,065 participants: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.43, I2 = 84%), intention to register/donate (dichotomous) (10 studies, 10,838 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.42, I2 = 91%) and intention to register/donate (continuous) (9 studies, 3572 participants: SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.36, I2 = 67%). Classroom-based interventions delivered in a lecture format by individuals from the transplant community may be effective at increasing intention to register/donate (3 studies, 675 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55, I² = 0%). Community interventions targeting specific ethnic groups were generally effective at increasing registration rates (k = 5, n = 4186; RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.40, I² = 85%), although heterogeneity was high. In particular, interventions delivered in the community by trained peer-leaders appear to be effective (3 studies, 3819 participant: RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.06, I² = 87%), although again, the data lacked robustness. There was some evidence that framing messages (e.g. anticipated regret) and priming individuals (e.g. reciprocity) in a certain way may increase intention to register/donate, however, few studies measured this effect on actual registration. Overall, the studies varied significantly in terms of design, setting, content and delivery. Selection bias was evident and a quarter of the studies could not be included in the meta-analysis due to incomplete outcome data reporting. No adverse events were reported. In our review, we identified a variety of approaches used to increase organ donor registration including school-based educational sessions and videos, leveraging peer leaders in the community, DMV staff training, targeted messaging and priming. The variability in outcome measures used and incompleteness in reporting meant that most data could not be combined for analysis. When data were combined, overall effect sizes were small in favour of intervention groups over controls, however, there was significant variability in the data. There was some evidence that leveraging peer-leaders in the community to deliver organ donation education may improve registration rates and classroom-based education from credible individuals (i.e. members of the transplant community) may improve intention to register/donate, however, there is no clear evidence favouring any particular approach. There was mixed evidence for simple, low-intensity interventions utilising message framing and priming. However, it is likely that interest in these strategies will persist due to their reach and scalability. Further research is therefore required to adequately address the question of the most effective interventions for increasing deceased organ donor registration.","Studies were conducted in widely different settings including schools, driver motor vehicle (DMV) centres, primary care and in the local community. Studies also used widely different strategies to increase registration such as education, training peer-leaders, training DMV or primary care staff, and framing information about organ donation in certain ways. We found that studies had a small overall effect on people’s intention to register/donate along with actual registration rates, however, no particular strategy stood out as being more effective than the rest. There was encouraging evidence that training peer-leaders in the community to deliver organ donation education may improve registration rates and classroom-based education from members of the transplant community may improve intention to register/donate. There was also some evidence that framing organ donation information in certain ways may help increase people’s intention to register/donate but further studies are needed. In summary, strategies to increase organ donation registration have some benefit but vary considerably in terms of the setting in which they are delivered, who they target and how they are delivered."
CD003416,"We included 17 RCTs in the review (2505 women). The main limitation was inadequate reporting of study methods and moderate to high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. A majority of the studies had low numbers of participants. None of the trials compared repeated single embryo transfer (SET) with multiple embryo transfer. Reported results of multiple embryo transfer below refer to double embryo transfer. Repeated single embryo transfer versus multiple embryo transfer in a single cycle
Repeated SET was compared with double embryo transfer (DET) in four studies of cleavage-stage transfer. In these studies the SET group received either two cycles of fresh SET (one study) or one cycle of fresh SET followed by one frozen SET (three studies). The cumulative live birth rate after repeated SET may be little or no different from the rate after one cycle of DET (RR 0.95, 95% CI (confidence interval) 0.82 to 1.10; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 985 participants; low-quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the repeated SET would yield pregnancy rates between 34% and 46%. The multiple pregnancy rate associated with repeated SET is probably reduced compared to a single cycle of DET (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 985 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a 13% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk following repeated SET would be between 0% and 3%. The clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; I² = 47%; 3 studies, 943 participants; low-quality evidence) after repeated SET may be little or no different from the rate after one cycle of DET. There may be little or no difference in the miscarriage rate between the two groups. Single versus multiple embryo transfer in a single cycle
A single cycle of SET was compared with a single cycle of DET in 13 studies, 11 comparing cleavage-stage transfers and three comparing blastocyst-stage transfers.One study reported both cleavage and blastocyst stage transfers. Low-quality evidence suggests that the live birth rate per woman may be reduced in women who have SET in comparison with those who have DET (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.75; I² = 0%; 12 studies, 1904 participants; low-quality evidence). Thus, for a woman with a 46% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following a single cycle of SET would be between 27% and 35%. The multiple pregnancy rate per woman is probably lower in those who have SET than those who have DET (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.22; I² = 0%; 13 studies, 1952 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a 15% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk following a single cycle of SET would be between 2% and 4%. Low-quality evidence suggests that the clinical pregnancy rate may be lower in women who have SET than in those who have DET (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.77; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1860 participants; low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the miscarriage rate between the two groups. Although DET achieves higher live birth and clinical pregnancy rates per fresh cycle, the evidence suggests that the difference in effectiveness may be substantially offset when elective SET is followed by a further transfer of a single embryo in fresh or frozen cycle, while simultaneously reducing multiple pregnancies, at least among women with a good prognosis. The quality of evidence was low to moderate primarily due to inadequate reporting of study methods and absence of masking those delivering, as well as receiving the interventions.","We found 17 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2505 participants. Most were not commercially funded. None of the trials compared repeated single embryo transfer (SET) with multiple embryo transfer. A majority of the studies had low numbers of participants. Reported results of multiple embryo transfer below refer to double embryo transfer. Repeated single embryo transfer versus multiple embryo transfer in a single cycle
Based on low-quality evidence, there was no indication that overall live birth and clinical pregnancy rates differed substantially when repeated SET (either two cycles of single embryo transfer or one cycle of single embryo transfer followed by transfer of a single frozen embryo) was compared with double embryo transfer (DET). For a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following repeated single embryo transfer would be between 34% and 46%. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that the risk of multiple birth is much lower in the SET group (between 0% and 3%) compared to a 13% chance of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET. The chance of miscarriage rate is similar between the two groups. Single versus multiple embryo transfer in a single cycle
We found low-quality evidence that the rates of live birth and clinical pregnancy (CPR) were lower after one cycle of fresh SET compared with the outcome of one cycle of fresh DET. For a woman with a 46% chance of live birth following one cycle of DET, the chance following one cycle of SET was between 27% and 35%. However, the risk of multiple pregnancy was higher after DET. There was no difference in the chance of miscarriage between the two groups. While live birth and clinical pregnancy was lower following SET compared to DET after single fresh cycle, there was no difference between overall live birth rate and CPR following consecutive SET versus a single cycle of DET. However, the multiple pregnancy rate is much lower following SET compared to DET. Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis. The quality of evidence was low to moderate primarily due to inadequate reporting of study methods and absence of masking those delivering, as well as receiving the interventions."
CD011344,"We included 18 studies of 4590 women, of which 13 enrolled healthy nulliparous women and five included healthy nulli- and multiparous women. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. Techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia differed between the studies: seven used combined spinal epidural, 10 used epidural, and one used dural puncture epidural (DPE). There was also variation in analgesics used. Eight studies utilised ropivacaine with fentanyl, three used ropivacaine with sufentanil, two utilised levobupivacaine with sufentanil, one used levobupivacaine with fentanyl, and four utilised bupivacaine with fentanyl. Most of the studies were assessed to have low risk of randomisation, blinding, attrition, and reporting biases, except for allocation concealment where eight studies were assessed to have uncertain risk and three with high risk. Our results showed that AMB was associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain compared to BI (risk ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.91; I2 = 57%) (16 studies, 1528 participants), and lower hourly LA consumption in bupivacaine equivalents (mean difference (MD) -0.84 mg/h; 95% CI -1.29 to -0.38, I2 = 87%) (16 studies, 1642 participants), both with moderate certainty. AMB was associated with an estimated reduction in breakthrough pain incidence of 29.1% (incidence 202 per 1000, 95% CI 157 to 259), and was therefore considered clinically significant. The incidence of caesarean delivery (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; I2 = 0%) (16 studies, 1735 participants) and instrumental delivery (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I2 = 0%) (17 studies, 4550 participants) were not significantly, both with moderate certainty. There was no significant difference in duration of labour analgesia (MD -8.81 min; 95% CI -19.38 to 1.77; I2 = 50%) (17 studies, 4544 participants) with moderate certainty. Due to differences in the methods and timing of outcome measurements, we did not pool data for maternal satisfaction and Apgar scores. Results reported narratively suggest AMB may be associated with increased maternal satisfaction (eight studies reported increased satisfaction and six reported no difference), and all studies showed no difference in Apgar scores. WIth the exception of epidural alone versus CSE which found significant subgroup differences in LA consumption between AMB and BI, no significant differences were detected in the remaining subgroup analyses. Overall, AMB is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain, reduced LA consumption, and may improve maternal satisfaction. There were no significant differences between AMB and BI in the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labour analgesia, and Apgar scores. Larger studies assessing the incidence of caesarean and instrumental delivery are required.","Prior studies have reported contradicting data regarding which method (AMB compared to BI) provides superior pain relief during labour, and previous systematic reviews are outdated as there have been several new studies published on this topic. Inclusion of their data may improve the precision of our results regarding the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of AMB versus BI for maintenance of epidural pain relief during labour. Hence, we aimed to compare AMB with BI in terms of:
- incidence of breakthrough pain (pain occurring during labour epidural requiring anaesthesiologist intervention)
- incidence of caesarean delivery
- incidence of instrumental delivery
Additionally, we compared AMB with BI in terms of duration of epidural analgesia and local anaesthetic consumption. We searched for studies that compared AMB with BI for labour epidural pain relief. We compared and summarised the results of these studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. Our review included 18 studies involving 4590 women at term with uncomplicated pregnancies. Overall, we found that AMB was associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and lower local anaesthetic consumption compared to BI, but both methods were comparable regarding the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, and duration of labour epidural. We have moderate confidence in the evidence, but it was limited by two main factors. First, there were differences between the studies in their respective methods, which includes differences in the types of medications used, stage of labour at which the epidural procedures were performed, and use of concurrent forms of pain relief in addition to labour epidural. These differences between the included studies could have contributed to the observed differences between AMB and BI. Second, some of our results were based on data obtained from a small number of women, which may have limited the precision of our findings. This review updates our previous review, and the evidence is up to date to 31 December 2022."
CD009536,"Seven trials involving 1558 participants were included in this review; 457 were involved in four trials of antibiotic medication, and 1101 were involved in three trials of beta-blocker medication. Five of the studies were rated at a high risk of bias. Individually, all of the included trials reported non-significant differences in AAA expansion rates between their intervention and control groups. The two major drug groups were then analysed separately. For AAA expansion it was only possible to combine two of the antibiotic trials in a meta-analysis. This demonstrated that roxithromycin had a small but significant protective effect (MD -0.86 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.57 to -0.14). When referral to AAA surgery was compared (including all four antibiotic trials in the meta-analysis), non-significantly fewer patients were referred in the intervention groups (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57) than the control groups. When only the trials reporting actual elective surgery were included in a subgroup analysis, the result remained statistically non-significant (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.57 to 2.42). For the beta-blocker trials, when all were combined in a meta-analysis, there was a very small, non-significant protective effect for propranolol on AAA expansion (MD -0.08 mm; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.10), and non-significantly fewer patients were referred to AAA surgery in the propranolol group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). Bronchospasm and shortness of breath were the main adverse effects from the beta-blockers. In one trial the adverse effects were reportedly so severe that the trial was stopped early after two years. There is some limited evidence that antibiotic medication may have a slight protective effect in retarding the expansion rates of small AAAs. The quality of the evidence makes it unclear whether this translates into fewer referrals to AAA surgery, owing mainly to the small sample sizes of the studies. Antibiotics were generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Propranolol was poorly tolerated by patients in all of the beta-blocker trials and demonstrated only minimal and non-significant protective effects. Further research on beta-blockers for AAA needs to consider the use of drugs other than propranolol. In general, there is surprisingly little high quality evidence on medical treatment for small AAAs, especially in relation to the use of newer beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins.","We identified seven trials involving 1558 participants where the aneurysm diameters of patients randomised to receive medical treatment were compared to those participants given a control medication or surveillance imaging alone. Four trials studied the effects of antibiotics on slowing aneurysm growth, and showed a small protective effect. Three trials studied the effects of beta-blockers, and demonstrated a very small protective effect. Notably, the beta-blocker drugs were associated with a large number of adverse effects. It was unclear whether either drug type delayed referral to aneurysm surgery. The accuracy of the results was limited by the low number of participants (especially important when trying to detect small changes in aneurysm growth rates) and some potentially damaging biases."
CD011856,"We included 17 observational studies in this review. We found no randomized controlled trials. Twelve studies are based in hospitals, three in prisons and two in universities. Three studies used a controlled before-and-after design, with another site used for comparison. The remaining 14 studies used an uncontrolled before-and-after study design. Five studies reported evidence from two participant groups, including staff and either patients or prisoners (depending on specialist setting), with the 12 remaining studies investigating only one participant group. The four studies (two in prisons, two in hospitals) providing health outcomes data reported an effect of reduced secondhand smoke exposure and reduced mortality associated with smoking-related illnesses. No studies included in the review measured cotinine levels to validate secondhand smoke exposure. Eleven studies reporting active smoking rates with 12,485 participants available for pooling, but with substantial evidence of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 72%). Heterogeneity was lower in subgroups defined by setting, and provided evidence for an effect of tobacco bans on reducing active smoking rates. An analysis exploring heterogeneity within hospital settings showed evidence of an effect on reducing active smoking rates in both staff (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval ( CI) 0.64 to 0.78) and patients (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98), but heterogeneity remained in the staff subgroup (I² = 76%). In prisons, despite evidence of reduced mortality associated with smoking-related illnesses in two studies, there was no evidence of effect on active smoking rates (1 study, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.16). We judged the quality of the evidence to be low, using the GRADE approach, as the included studies are all observational. We found evidence of an effect of settings-based smoking policies on reducing smoking rates in hospitals and universities. In prisons, reduced mortality rates and reduced exposure to secondhand smoke were reported. However, we rated the evidence base as low quality. We therefore need more robust studies assessing the evidence for smoking bans and policies in these important specialist settings.","We searched for studies that measured whether introducing a smoking policy or ban, in hospitals, universities or prisons, reduced secondhand smoke exposure and helped people to quit smoking. The study could be in any language. It had to report information on health and smoking before the policy or ban started and for at least six months afterwards. We have included 17 studies in this review. Twelve studies provide evidence from hospitals, three from prisons and two from universities. The evidence is up-to-date to June 2015. We grouped together 11 of the included studies, involving 12,485 people, and found that banning smoking in hospitals and universities increased the number of smoking quit attempts and reduced the number of people smoking. In prisons, there was a reduction in the number of people who died from diseases related to smoking and a reduction in exposure to secondhand smoke after policies and bans were introduced, but there was no evidence of reduced smoking rates. We found no relevant high-quality studies to include in our review. Future high-quality research may lead to a change in these conclusions and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions from the current evidence. We need more research from larger studies to investigate smoking bans and policies in these important settings."
CD008997,"A total of 798 studies were identified following the initial search. No published or unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing primary tumour resection versus no resection in asymptomatic patients with unresectable stage IV colorectal cancer who were treated with chemo/radiotherapy were identified. Seven non-randomised studies, potentially eligible for inclusion, were identified: 2 case-matched studies, 2 CCTs and 3 retrospective cohort studies. Overall, these trials included 1.086 patients (722 patients treated with primary tumour resection, and 364 patients managed first with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). Resection of the primary tumour in asymptomatic patients with unresectable stage IV colorectal cancer who are managed with chemo/radiotherapy is not associated with a consistent improvement in overall survival. In addition, resection does not significantly reduce the risk of complications from the primary tumour (i.e. obstruction, perforation or bleeding). Yet there is enough doubt with regard to the published literature to justify further clinical trials in this area. The results from an ongoing high quality randomised controlled trial will help to answer this question.","Some studies have suggested that resecting the primary cancer can prolong survival and prevent complication arising from the cancer, such as obstruction or bleeding. This review addresses the question of whether surgically removing the primary cancer is beneficial to patients with advanced and unresectable colorectal cancer. No randomised controlled trials were identified."
CD006536,"Forty-one RCTs with a total of 2732 participants (1564 cell therapy, 1168 controls) were eligible for inclusion. Cell treatment was not associated with any changes in the risk of all-cause mortality (34/538 versus 32/458; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.50; 996 participants; 14 studies; moderate quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (23/277 versus 18/250; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.99; 527 participants; nine studies; moderate quality evidence) or a composite measure of mortality, reinfarction and re-hospitalisation for heart failure (24/262 versus 33/235; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.10; 497 participants; six studies; moderate quality evidence) at long-term follow-up. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2  = 0% to 12%). Serious periprocedural adverse events were rare and were generally unlikely to be related to cell therapy. Additionally, cell therapy had no effect on morbidity, quality of life/performance or LVEF measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Meta-analyses of LVEF measured by echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography and left ventricular angiography showed evidence of differences in mean LVEF between treatment groups although the mean differences ranged between 2% and 5%, which are accepted not to be clinically relevant. Results were robust to the risk of selection, performance and attrition bias from individual studies. The results of this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence for a beneficial effect of cell therapy for AMI patients. However, most of the evidence comes from small trials that showed no difference in clinically relevant outcomes. Further adequately powered trials are needed and until then the efficacy of this intervention remains unproven.","Randomised trials comparing bone marrow-derived cells with no cells in patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction were eligible for this review. We searched databases to March 2015. This review was supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) through its Cochrane Incentive Award programme. In this updated systematic review we analysed data from a total of 41 trials with over 2700 patients. Evaluation of the currently available evidence indicates that this treatment may not lead to improvement when compared to standard treatment, as measured by the frequency of deaths, heart attacks and/or heart failure requiring re-hospitalisation following treatment, as well as tests of heart function, in the short and long term. The evidence in this review is of moderate quality due to the small number of events."
CD005355,"Eighteen RCTs with 1250 participants met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in hospital settings in low, middle and high income countries. Blood loss
We found significant reductions in blood loss with the following interventions:
vaginal misoprostol (2 RCTs, 89 women: MD -97.88 ml, 95% CI -125.52 to -70.24; I2 = 43%; moderate-quality evidence); intramyometrial vasopressin (3 RCTs, 128 women: MD -245.87 ml, 95% CI -434.58 to -57.16; I2 = 98%; moderate-quality evidence); intramyometrial bupivacaine plus epinephrine (1 RCT, 60 women: MD -68.60 ml, 95% CI -93.69 to -43.51; low-quality evidence); intravenous tranexamic acid (1 RCT, 100 women: MD -243 ml, 95% CI -460.02 to -25.98; low-quality evidence); gelatin-thrombin matrix (1 RCT, 50 women: MD -545.00 ml, 95% CI -593.26 to -496.74; low-quality evidence); intravenous ascorbic acid (1 RCT, 102 women: MD -411.46 ml, 95% CI -502.58 to -320.34; low-quality evidence); vaginal dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: MD -131.60 ml, 95% CI -253.42 to -9.78; low-quality evidence); loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule (1 RCT, 70 women: MD -305.01 ml, 95% CI -354.83 to -255.19; low-quality evidence); a fibrin sealant patch (1 RCT, 70 women: MD -26.50 ml, 95% CI -44.47 to -8.53; low-quality evidence), a Foley catheter tied around the cervix (1 RCT, 93 women: MD -240.70 ml, 95% CI -359.61 to -121.79; low-quality evidence), and a polyglactin suture round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament (1 RCT, 28 women: MD -1870.0 ml, 95% CI -2547.16 to 1192.84; low-quality evidence). There was no good evidence of an effect on blood loss with oxytocin, morcellation or clipping of the uterine artery. Need for blood transfusion
We found significant reductions in the need for blood transfusion with vasopressin (2 RCTs, 90 women: OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence); tourniquet tied round the cervix (1 RCT, 98 women: OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.55; low-quality evidence); tourniquet tied round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament (1 RCT, 28 women: OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23; low-quality evidence); gelatin-thrombin matrix (1 RCT, 100 women: OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10; low-quality evidence) and dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; low-quality evidence), but no evidence of effect on the need for blood transfusion with misoprostol, oxytocin, tranexamic acid, ascorbic acid, loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule and a fibrin sealant patch. There were insufficient data on the adverse effects and costs of the different interventions. At present there is moderate-quality evidence that misoprostol or vasopressin may reduce bleeding during myomectomy, and low-quality evidence that bupivacaine plus epinephrine, tranexamic acid, gelatin-thrombin matrix, ascorbic acid, dinoprostone, loop ligation, a fibrin sealant patch, a peri-cervical tourniquet or a tourniquet tied round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament may reduce bleeding during myomectomy. There is no evidence that oxytocin, morcellation and temporary clipping of the uterine artery reduce blood loss. Further well designed studies are required to establish the effectiveness, safety and costs of different interventions for reducing blood loss during myomectomy.","The evidence is current to June 2014. The review included 18 studies with a total of 1250 women who had myomectomy for uterine fibroids. All studies compared an intervention to reduce bleeding during myomectomy with either a placebo or no such treatment. The data available suggest that vaginal insertion of misoprostol and infiltration of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. Limited data available also suggest that chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) during surgery, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, the use of fibrin sealant patch (a surgical patch that improves blood clotting) or a tourniquet around the cervix or around both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligamentmay be effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. We found limited information on the harms (adverse effects) of the different interventions. There is moderate-quality evidence that misoprostol reduces blood loss by between 70.24 ml and 125.52 ml; with a laparotomy vasopressin reduces blood loss by between 392.51 and 507.49 ml during myomectomy, and by between 121.73 ml and 172.17 ml during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is low-quality evidence for the rest of the interventions (chemical dissection, dinoprostone, gelatin-thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, vitamin C, mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine, a fibrin sealant patch and the two types of tourniquet)."
CD013305,"Fifty-three studies with 5495 participants were included; 51 parallel group RCTs and two cluster-RCTs. We found moderate-certainty evidence that behavioural activation had greater short-term efficacy than treatment as usual (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.78; 7 RCTs, 1533 participants), although this difference was no longer evident in sensitivity analyses using a worst-case or intention-to-treat scenario. Compared with waiting list, behavioural activation may be more effective, but there were fewer data in this comparison and evidence was of low certainty (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 5.09; 1 RCT, 26 participants). No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for behavioural activation versus placebo and behavioural activation versus no treatment. We found moderate-certainty evidence suggesting no evidence of a difference in short-term treatment efficacy between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 5 RCTs, 601 participants). Fewer data were available for other comparators. No evidence of a difference in short term-efficacy was found between behavioural activation and third-wave CBT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 98 participants; low certainty), and psychodynamic therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.99; 1 RCT,60 participants; very low certainty). Behavioural activation was more effective than humanistic therapy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.95; 2 RCTs, 46 participants; low certainty) and medication (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.76; 1 RCT; 141 participants; moderate certainty), but both of these results were based on a small number of trials and participants. No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for comparisons between behavioural activation versus interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies. There was moderate-certainty evidence that behavioural activation might have lower treatment acceptability (based on dropout rate) than treatment as usual in the short term, although the data did not confirm a difference and results lacked precision (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31; 14 RCTs, 2518 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence did not suggest any difference in short-term acceptability between behavioural activation and waiting list (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.93; 8 RCTs. 359 participants), no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.09; 3 RCTs, 187 participants), medication (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.16; 2 RCTs, 243 participants), or placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.67; 1 RCT; 96 participants; low-certainty evidence). No evidence on treatment acceptability was available comparing behavioural activation versus psychodynamic therapy. Low-certainty evidence did not show a difference in short-term treatment acceptability (dropout rate) between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 12 RCTs, 1195 participants), third-wave CBT (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 RCTs, 147 participants); humanistic therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.55; 2 RCTs, 96 participants) (very low certainty), and interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, 123 participants). Results from medium- and long-term primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses are summarised in the text. This systematic review suggests that behavioural activation may be more effective than humanistic therapy, medication, and treatment as usual, and that it may be no less effective than CBT, psychodynamic therapy, or being placed on a waiting list. However, our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in short-term treatment acceptability (based on dropouts) between behavioural activation and most comparison groups (CBT, humanistic therapy, waiting list, placebo, medication, no treatment or treatment as usual). Again, our confidence in all these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. No data were available about the efficacy of behavioural activation compared with placebo, or about treatment acceptability comparing behavioural activation and psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and integrative therapies. The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and better quality RCTs of behavioural activation and by assessing working mechanisms of behavioural activation.","Behavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. We found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third-wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. Behavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third-wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. Behavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. Most findings were short-term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted."
CD009394,"We included one study, involving 40 infants and 42 women. The trial was underpowered to detect clinically important outcome differences between the two policies. There were no significant benefits or adverse effects of elective preterm birth at 36 weeks' gestation for fetal gastroschisis. The primary outcomes were caesarean section and neonatal survival to discharge. Two babies died after birth but before discharge in the elective (intervention) group versus none in the spontaneous group (risk ratio (RR) 5.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 98.00; one study, n = 40). Seven women (33%) in the elective group and nine women (43%) in the spontaneous group delivered by caesarean section (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.70). Similarly, for the secondary outcomes, there were no statistical differences in birthweight, ventilation requirements, necrotising enterocolitis and requirement for repeat surgery between the two groups. None of our prespecified maternal secondary outcomes were reported in the included study. We also examined gestational age at birth as a non-prespecified outcome. There was a difference in gestational age at birth between the two arms of the trial (35.8 weeks (SD 0.7) in the elective group and 36.7 (SD 1.5) in the spontaneous group. Possible reasons for this small mean difference include a trend towards spontaneous preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by fetal gastroschisis. This review is unable to draw any firm conclusions regarding preterm birth for infants with gastroschisis. It is not possible to say whether the intervention is beneficial or harmful for these babies or their mothers. Only one small trial is included. Further research is needed in this area.","This review identified one small randomised controlled trials, involving 42 women. There were no significant differences in outcomes for mother or baby when pre-term birth at 36 weeks was planned, compared with later birth. However, it was such a small trial that it does not rule out important benefits or harms from early birth. There was also small overall difference in gestational age at birth between the two groups in the trial, possibly because of the high rate of spontaneous preterm birth with this condition. Further trials are needed."
CD003419,"Twelve trials of six to 14 months duration involving 350 people were included. Eleven trials investigated levothyroxine replacement with placebo, one study compared levothyroxine replacement with no treatment. We did not identify any trial that assessed (cardiovascular) mortality or morbidity. Seven studies evaluated symptoms, mood and quality of life with no statistically significant improvement. One study showed a statistically significant improvement in cognitive function. Six studies assessed serum lipids, there was a trend for reduction in some parameters following levothyroxine replacement. Some echocardiographic parameters improved after levothyroxine replacement therapy, like myocardial relaxation, as indicated by a significant prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time as well as diastolic dysfunction. Only four studies reported adverse events with no statistically significant differences between groups. In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. Some evidence indicates that levothyroxine replacement improves some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function.","To answer this question twelve studies of six to 14 months duration involving 350 people were analysed. Thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity (for example less heart attacks or strokes). Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between placebo and thyroid hormone therapy. Some evidence indicated that thyroid hormone had some effects on blood lipids and technical measurements of heart function. Adverse effects were inadequately addressed in most of the included studies and have to be urgently investigated in future studies, especially in older patients."
CD007201,"We included four studies involving 644 pregnant women. Three studies were randomised controlled trials and one trial was a quasi-randomised study. A higher dose of oxytocin was associated with a significant reduction in length of labour reported from one trial (mean difference (MD) -3.50 hours; 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.38 to -0.62; one trial, 40 women). There was a decrease in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.62; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.86 four trials, 644 women) and an increase in the rate of spontaneous vaginal birth in the high-dose group (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.62, three trials, 444 women), although for both of these outcomes there were inconsistencies between studies in the size of effect. When we carried out sensitivity analysis (temporarily removing a study at high risk of bias) the differences between groups were no longer statistically significant
There were no significant differences between high- and low-dose regimens for instrumental vaginal birth, epidural analgesia, hyperstimulation, postpartum haemorrhage, chorioamnionitis or women's perceptions of experiences. For neonatal outcomes, there was no significant difference between groups for Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, admission to special care baby unit, or neonatal mortality. The following outcomes were not evaluated in the included studies: perinatal mortality, uterine rupture, abnormal cardiotocography, women's pyrexia, dystocia and neonatal neurological morbidity. Higher-dose regimens of oxytocin (4 mU per minute or more) were associated with a reduction in the length of labour and in caesarean section, and an increase in spontaneous vaginal birth. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that high-dose regimens are advised routinely for women with delay in the first stage of labour. Further research should evaluate the effect of high-dose regimens of oxytocin for women delayed in labour and should include maternal and neonatal outcomes as well as the effects on women.","From the four randomised controlled trials involving 644 pregnant women that we included in this review, results indicate that a higher dose of oxytocin (4-7 mU per minute, compared with 1-2 mU per minute) reduced the length of labour and the rate of caesarean sections with increased spontaneous vaginal births, but the studies did not provide enough evidence on possible differences between the high- and low-dose regimens on adverse events including hyperstimulation of the uterus, and outcomes for the newborn infant. Only one trial reported on the possible effect on women. The overall quality of the included trials was mixed, but this might reflect how clinical trials were reported in the past. While the current evidence is promising and suggests that the high-dose regimens reduce the length of labour and the rate of caesarean sections, this evidence is not strong enough to recommend that high-dose regimens are used routinely for women delayed in labour. We recommend that further research is carried out."
CD001396,"Thirty-one RCTs were included in the review. They compared fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram versus placebo. SSRIs reduced overall self-rated symptoms significantly more effectively than placebo. The effect size was moderate when studies reporting end scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.84, nine studies, 1276 women; moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 58%), low quality evidence). The effect size was small when studies reporting change scores were pooled (for moderate dose SSRIs: SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.51, four studies, 657 women; low heterogeneity (I2=29%), moderate quality evidence). SSRIs were effective for symptom relief whether taken only in the luteal phase or continuously, with no clear evidence of a difference in effectiveness between these modes of administration. However, few studies directly compared luteal and continuous regimens and more evidence is needed on this question. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were significantly more likely to occur in the SSRI group (moderate dose: OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.53, 15 studies, 2447 women; no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%), moderate quality evidence). The most common side effects associated with a moderate dose of SSRIs were nausea (NNH = 7), asthenia or decreased energy (NNH = 9), somnolence (NNH = 13), fatigue (NNH = 14), decreased libido (NNH = 14) and sweating (NNH = 14). In secondary analyses, SSRIs were effective for treating specific types of symptoms (that is psychological, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability). Adverse effects were dose-related. The overall quality of the evidence was low to moderate, the main weakness in the included studies being poor reporting of methods. Heterogeneity was low or absent for most outcomes, though (as noted above) there was moderate heterogeneity for one of the primary analyses. SSRIs are effective in reducing the symptoms of PMS, whether taken in the luteal phase only or continuously. Adverse effects are relatively frequent, the most common being nausea and asthenia. Adverse effects are dose-dependent.","The review included 31 randomised controlled trials which compared SSRIs with placebo in a total of 4372 women who were clinically diagnosed with PMS. SSRIs were found to be effective for reducing the overall symptoms of PMS and also for reducing specific types of symptoms (psychological, physical and functional symptoms, and irritability). SSRIs were usually taken for about two weeks before the start of the menstrual period (the luteal phase) or every day (continuously). Both regimens appeared to be equally effective, although more research is needed to confirm this. Adverse effects were more common in the women taking SSRIs than in those taking placebo. The most commonly occurring side effects were nausea and decreased energy. The review authors calculated that nausea is likely to occur as a drug side effect in approximately one out of seven women with PMS taking a moderate dose of SSRIs, and lack of energy is likely to occur as a drug side effect in approximately one out of every nine women. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low to moderate, the main weakness being poor reporting of methods in the included studies. At least 21 of the studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies."
CD008676,"We included 51 studies that analysed a total of 5345 participants. One study was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining 50 being at high risk of bias, however, this did not affect the quality assessments for gingivitis and plaque as we believe that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Gingivitis
After 4 to 6 weeks of use, chlorhexidine mouthrinse reduced gingivitis (Gingival Index (GI) 0 to 3 scale) by 0.21 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.31) compared to placebo, control or no mouthrinse (10 trials, 805 participants with mild gingival inflammation (mean score 1 on the GI scale) analysed, high-quality evidence). A similar effect size was found for reducing gingivitis at 6 months. There were insufficient data to determine the reduction in gingivitis associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use in individuals with mean GI scores of 1.1 to 3 (moderate or severe levels of gingival inflammation). Plaque
Plaque was measured by different indices and the SMD at 4 to 6 weeks was 1.45 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.90) standard deviations lower in the chlorhexidine group (12 trials, 950 participants analysed, high-quality evidence), indicating a large reduction in plaque. A similar large reduction was found for chlorhexidine mouthrinse use at 6 months. Extrinsic tooth staining
There was a large increase in extrinsic tooth staining in participants using chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 4 to 6 weeks. The SMD was 1.07 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.34) standard deviations higher (eight trials, 415 participants analysed, moderate-quality evidence) in the chlorhexidine mouthrinse group. There was also a large increase in extrinsic tooth staining in participants using chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 7 to 12 weeks and 6 months. Calculus
Results for the effect of chlorhexidine mouthrinse on calculus formation were inconclusive. Effect of concentration and frequency of rinsing
There were insufficient data to determine whether there was a difference in effect for either chlorhexidine concentration or frequency of rinsing. Other adverse effects
The adverse effects most commonly reported in the included studies were taste disturbance/alteration (reported in 11 studies), effects on the oral mucosa including soreness, irritation, mild desquamation and mucosal ulceration/erosions (reported in 13 studies) and a general burning sensation or a burning tongue or both (reported in nine studies). There is high-quality evidence from studies that reported the Löe and Silness Gingival Index of a reduction in gingivitis in individuals with mild gingival inflammation on average (mean score of 1 on the 0 to 3 GI scale) that was not considered to be clinically relevant. There is high-quality evidence of a large reduction in dental plaque with chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for 4 to 6 weeks and 6 months. There is no evidence that one concentration of chlorhexidine rinse is more effective than another. There is insufficient evidence to determine the reduction in gingivitis associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use in individuals with mean GI scores of 1.1 to 3 indicating moderate or severe levels of gingival inflammation. Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinse for 4 weeks or longer causes extrinsic tooth staining. In addition, other adverse effects such as calculus build up, transient taste disturbance and effects on the oral mucosa were reported in the included studies.","We included 51 studies that analysed a total of 5345 participants. The evidence in this review is up to date as of 28 September 2016. Generally study participants were children and adults who had gingivitis or periodontitis, were able to use usual tooth cleaning methods and were healthy. We did not exclude studies where some or all participants had medical conditions or special care needs as we considered the use of mouthrinses with chlorhexidine to be particularly relevant to them. The included studies assessed the effects of chlorhexidine mouthrinse used for at least 4 weeks in addition to conventional tooth cleaning on gingivitis in children and adults. There is high-quality evidence that the use of mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine in addition to usual toothbrushing and cleaning for 4 to 6 weeks or 6 months leads to a large reduction in the build-up of plaque. There is also high-quality evidence of a moderate reduction in gingivitis in people with a mild level of it, although because the level of disease was already low this is not considered clinically important. The nature of the available evidence does not allow us to determine the level of reduction of gingivitis in people with moderate to severe levels of it. There was no evidence that one concentration or strength of chlorhexidine rinse was more effective than another. Rinsing for 4 weeks or longer causes tooth staining, which requires scaling and polishing carried out by a dental professional. Other side effects have been reported, including build-up of calculus (tartar), temporary taste disturbance and temporary shedding of/damage to the lining of the mouth. One study was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining 50 being at high risk of bias, however this did not affect the quality assessments for gingivitis and plaque as we believe that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect."
CD012803,"We included 16 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2125 participants. The trials evaluated PAP therapy consisting of ASV or continuous PAP therapy for 1 to 31 months. Many trials included participants with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Only one trial included participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We are uncertain about the effects of PAP therapy on all-cause mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.21; participants = 1804; studies = 6; I2 = 47%; very low-quality evidence). We found moderate-quality evidence of no difference between PAP therapy and usual care on cardiac-related mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24; participants = 1775; studies = 5; I2 = 11%). We found low-quality evidence of no difference between PAP therapy and usual care on all-cause rehospitalisation (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; participants = 1533; studies = 5; I2 = 40%) and cardiac-related rehospitalisation (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35; participants = 1533; studies = 5; I2 = 40%). In contrast, PAP therapy showed some indication of an improvement in quality of life scores assessed by all measurements (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.67 to 0.04; participants = 1617; studies = 6; I2 = 76%; low-quality evidence) and by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MD −0.51, 95% CI −0.78 to −0.24; participants = 1458; studies = 4; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence) compared with usual care. Death due to pneumonia (N = 1, 3% of PAP group); cardiac arrest (N = 18, 3% of PAP group); heart transplantation (N = 8, 1% of PAP group); cardiac worsening (N = 3, 9% of PAP group); deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (N = 1, 3% of PAP group); and foot ulcer (N = 1, 3% of PAP group) occurred in the PAP therapy group, whereas cardiac arrest (N = 16, 2% of usual care group); heart transplantation (N = 12, 2% of usual care group); cardiac worsening (N = 5, 14% of usual care group); and duodenal ulcer (N = 1, 3% of usual care group) occurred in the usual care group across three trials. The effect of PAP therapy on all-cause mortality was uncertain. In addition, although we found evidence that PAP therapy did not reduce the risk of cardiac-related mortality and rehospitalisation, there was some indication of an improvement in quality of life for heart failure patients with CSA. Furthermore, the evidence was insufficient to determine whether adverse events were more common with PAP than with usual care. These findings were limited by low- or very low-quality evidence. PAP therapy may be worth considering for individuals with heart failure to improve quality of life.","We assessed the the quality of evidence for many outcomes including cardiac-related rehospitalisation as low or very low because variability among studies (heterogeneity) was high, a range of confidence intervals was wide, and random sequence generation and blinding of participants and personnel were poorly described. The effect of PAP therapy on all-cause mortality was uncertain. In addition, although PAP therapy did not reduce the risk of cardiac-related mortality and rehospitalisation, there was some indication of an improvement in quality of life score for heart failure patients with CSA. Furthermore, the evidence was insufficient to determine whether adverse events were more common with PAP than with usual care. These findings were limited by low- or very low-quality evidence. PAP therapy may be worth considering for individuals with heart failure to improve quality of life."
CD009014,"We found one small RCT, judged to be at low risk of bias, that enrolled 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with evidence of sensitisation to peanut and a clinical history of reaction to peanut within 60 minutes of exposure. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had a history of severe peanut anaphylaxis. Randomisation was in a 2:1 ratio resulting in 19 children being randomised to the intervention arm and nine to the placebo arm. Intervention arm children received OIT with peanut flour and control arm participants received placebo comprising of oat flour. The primary outcome was assessed using a double-blind, placebo controlled oral food challenge (OFC) at approximately one year. No data were available on longer term outcomes beyond the OFC conducted at the end of the study. Because of adverse events, three patients withdrew from the intervention arm before the completion of the study. Therefore, only 16 participants received the full course of peanut OIT, whereas all nine patients receiving placebo completed the trial. The per-protocol analysis found a significant increase in the threshold dose of peanut allergen required to trigger a reaction in those in the intervention arm with all 16 participants able to ingest the maximum cumulative dose of 5000 mg of peanut protein (which the authors equate as being equivalent to approximately 20 peanuts) without developing symptoms, whereas in the placebo group they were able to ingest a median cumulative dose of 280 mg (range: 0 to 1900 mg, P < 0.001) before experiencing symptoms. Per-protocol analyses also demonstrated that peanut OIT resulted in reductions in skin prick test size (P < 0.001), interleukin-5 (P = 0.01), interleukin-13 (P = 0.02) and an increase in peanut-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) (P < 0.01). Children in the intervention arm experienced more adverse events during treatment than those in the placebo arm. In the initial day escalation phase, nine (47%) of the 19 participants initially enrolled in the OIT arm experienced clinically-relevant adverse events which required treatment with H1-antihistamines, two of which required additional treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline). The one small RCT we found showed that allergen-specific peanut OIT can result in desensitisation in children, and that this is associated with evidence of underlying immune-modulation. However, this treatment approach was associated with a substantial risk of adverse events, although the majority of these were mild. In view of the risk of adverse events and the lack of evidence of long-term benefits, allergen-specific peanut OIT cannot currently be recommended as a treatment for the management of patients with IgE-mediated peanut allergy. Larger RCTs are needed to investigate the acceptability, long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of safer treatment regimens, particularly in relation to the induction of clinical and immunological tolerance.","We found one small trial undertaken in 28 children aged 1 to 16 years with confirmed peanut allergy. The study did not include children who had moderate to severe asthma or who had had severe anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction that may result in death) because of their peanut allergy. The authors randomised children to intervention or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Intervention arm children received peanut flour whereas control arm participants received oat flour. The 48-week trial showed that treatment with peanut OIT enabled children receiving OIT to substantially increase the amount of peanut flour they ate in comparison with those in the placebo arm without having an allergic reaction. However, almost half of the children (nine out of 19) receiving OIT had an allergic reaction due to the OIT which required antihistamines, and two had more serious reactions to the treatment which required adrenaline (epinephrine). Although promising, based on the findings of this one small trial, we cannot recommend that peanut OIT be used routinely for people with peanut allergy. There is a need for further larger studies investigating safer OIT regimens and establishing the long-term effectiveness of OIT after treatment is stopped."
CD005216,"Fourty RCTs were included, addressing various agents for pregnancy termination and methods of administration. When used alone, misoprostol was an effective inductive agent, though it appeared to be more effective in combination with mifepristone. However, the evidence from RCTs is limited. Misoprostol was preferably administered vaginally, although among multiparous women sublingual administration appeared equally effective. A range of doses of vaginally administered misoprostol has been used. No randomised trials comparing doses of misoprostol were identified; however low doses of misoprostol appear to be associated with fewer side-effects while moderate doses appear to be more efficient in completing abortion. Four RCTs showed that the induction to abortion interval with 3-hourly vaginal administration of prostaglandins is shorter than 6-hourly administration without an increase in side-effects. Many studies reported the need for surgical evacuation. Indications for surgical evacuation include retained products of the placenta and heavy vaginal bleeding. Fewer women required surgical evacuation when misoprostol was administrated vaginally compared with women receiving intra-amniotical PGF2a. Mild, self-limiting diarrhoea was more common among women who received misoprostol compared to other agents. Medical abortion in the second trimester using the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol appeared to have the highest efficacy and shortest abortion time interval. Where mifepristone is not available, misoprostol alone is a reasonable alternative. The optimal route for administering misoprostol is vaginally, preferably using tablets at 3-hourly intervals. Apart from pain, the side-effects of vaginal misoprostol are usually mild and self limiting. Conclusions from this review are limited by the gestational age ranges and variable medical regimens, including dosing, administrative routes and intervals of medication, of the included trials.","We identified 38 studies and came to the conclusion that misoprostol is the drug of choice for medical pregnancy termination, preferably in combination with mifepristone which facilitates the effectiveness of misoprostol. Misoprostol works best when it is administered into the vagina. Women who had previously given birth could take misoprostol by mouth (under the tongue). Irrespective of the medication used for second trimester termination there is a considerable risk of surgical intervention because of vaginal bleeding or incomplete abortion."
CD001912,"We included four studies, with a total of 401 randomised participants aged zero to seven years on enrolment; one study is ongoing. The two older included studies generally had a higher risk of bias across all domains, but in particular due to a lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data, than the two more recent studies. We only regarded the most recent study as being generally free of bias, although even here we were not certain of the effect of the per protocol analysis on the study results. Evidence quality was judged to be low for all outcomes assessed after being downgraded based on GRADE assessments. Downgrading decisions were due to limitations in study design (all outcomes), for imprecision and for inconsistency . Prophylactic anti-staphylococcal antibiotics probably make little or no difference to lung function measured as FEV1 % predicted after six years (mean difference (MD) -2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.59 to 8.99, one study, n = 119, low-quality evidence); but may reduce the number of children having one or more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus at two years (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35, three studies, n = 315, low-quality evidence). At the same time point, there may be little or no effect on nutrition as reported using weight z score (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.45, two studies, n = 140, low-quality evidence), additional courses of antibiotics (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.60, one study, n = 119, low-quality evidence) or adverse effects (low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa between groups at two years (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.23, three studies, n = 312, low-quality evidence), though there was a trend towards a lower cumulative isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the prophylaxis group at two and three years and towards a higher rate from four to six years. As the studies reviewed lasted six years or less, conclusions cannot be drawn about the long-term effects of prophylaxis. Anti-staphylococcal antibiotic prophylaxis may lead to fewer children having isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, when commenced early in infancy and continued up to six years of age. The clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. Further research may establish whether the trend towards more children with CF with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, after four to six years of prophylaxis, is a chance finding and whether choice of antibiotic or duration of treatment might influence this.","The review includes four studies with 401 children; there were no adult studies. The children were put into groups at random and received either an oral antibiotic continuously as a prevention for at least one year or no antibiotic treatment to prevent infection with Staphylococcus aureus. All children could be given additional antibiotics if their doctor thought they needed them, based on symptoms and germs grown in their respiratory secretions. Studies lasted for a maximum of six years. The review found some low-quality evidence that giving regular antibiotics to young children (continued up to six years of age) may lead to fewer infections with Staphylococcus aureus. For other outcomes in the review (weight, need for additional antibiotics, side effects or the number of infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa) there was no difference between giving regular antibiotics or not. Since none of the studies lasted longer than six years, we can't draw any conclusions about long-term use. Also, since all studies were in children, we can not comment on the use of these drugs in adults. Future research should seek more fully to address whether this treatment reduces, increases or has no effect on subsequent rates of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and look at patterns of antibiotic resistance and survival. A large ongoing study called CF-START aims to address these uncertainties. Overall, the quality of the evidence was concerning. All the studies were of variable quality and we judged the quality of the evidence to be low for the outcomes we assessed. We judged that the two older studies had a higher risk of bias overall compared to the two newer studies. In particular this was because those taking part in the studies (or their parents or caregivers) would be able to guess which treatment they were receiving, and also one study did not state if anyone had dropped out and if so what the reasons were. Only the newest study seemed to be free of bias, although even here we were not certain if the study results were distorted by the way the data were analysed. Given these concerns, if results from future trials confirm the current findings, it would increase our certainty in our conclusions."
CD005046,"Seven studies involving 178 participants were included. Two studies were excluded from the meta-analysis of remission rates on the basis of clinical heterogeneity of the initial endoscopic protocols. There was no significant difference between PD or BTX treatment in remission within four weeks of the initial intervention; with a risk ratio of remission of 1.11 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.27). There was also no significant difference in the mean oesophageal pressures between the treatment groups; with a weighted mean difference for PD of -0.77 (95% CI -2.44 to 0.91, P = 0.37). Data on remission rates following the initial endoscopic treatment were available for three studies at six months and four studies at 12 months. At six months 46 of 57 PD participants were in remission compared to 29 of 56 in the BTX group, giving a risk ratio of 1.57 (95% CI 1.19 to 2.08, P = 0.0015); whilst at 12 months 55 of 75 PD participants were in remission compared to 27 of 72 BTX participants, with a risk ratio of 1.88 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.61, P = 0.0002). No serious adverse outcomes occurred in participants receiving BTX, whilst PD was complicated by perforation in three cases. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that PD is the more effective endoscopic treatment in the long term (greater than six months) for patients with achalasia.","We set out to undertake a systematic review comparing randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of PD and BTX injection in people with achalasia. We searched databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library) in April 2014 for reports of relevant randomised controlled trials. Seven randomised controlled trials were identified for inclusion in the review, and five were suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis suggested that, although both interventions had similar initial response rates, the remission rates at six and 12 months were significantly greater with PD than with BTX injection."
CD009189,"Out of 14 717 citations, 11 RCTs met the inclusion criteria (1381 participants). Six studies addressed outcomes relating to medication adherence, and there was some evidence from two studies that telephone interventions can improve adherence. A meta-analysis of three studies for which there was sufficient data showed no significant benefit (SMD 0.49, 95% CI -1.12 to 2.11). There was some evidence from a study of young substance abusing HIV positive persons of the efficacy of telephone interventions for reducing risky sexual behaviour, while a trial of older persons found no benefit. Three RCTs addressed virologic outcomes, and there is very little evidence that telephone interventions improved virologic outcomes. Five RCTs addressed outcomes relating to depressive and psychiatric symptoms, and showed some evidence that telephone interventions can be of benefit. Three of these studies which focussed on depressive symptoms were combined in a meta-analysis, which showed no significant benefit (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.21 95% CI). Telephone voice interventions may have a role in improving medication adherence, reducing risky sexual behaviour, and reducing depressive and psychiatric symptoms, but current evidence is sparse, and further research is needed.","The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of using the telephone to deliver interventions to improve the health of PLHIV compared to standard care. A comprehensive search of various scientific databases and other resources found 11 relevant studies. All of the studies were performed in the United States, and so the results may not apply to other countries, particularly developing countries. Some studies were aimed at any HIV positive person in the area in which the study was carried out, and others focused on specific groups of people, such as young substance using PLHIV, or older PLHIV. There were a lot of differences in the types of telephone interventions used in each study. There was some evidence that telephone interventions can improve medication adherence, reduce risky sexual behaviour, and reduce symptoms of depression in PLHIV. However, there were also a number of studies that suggested that telephone interventions were no more effective than usual care alone. We need more studies conducted in different settings to assess the effectiveness of telephone interventions for improving the health of PLHIV."
CD011054,"In total, we identified 1298 publications through the search strategy. We included 28 publications reporting on 24 studies. COC users were at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke compared with non-users: relative risk (RR) 1.6 (95% CI 1.3-1.9).These RRs were similar for myocardial infarction (1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1) and ischemic stroke (1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9). The risks did not vary clearly according to the generation of progestagen or according to progestagen type. When we stratified preparations according to estrogen dose, the risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke seemed to increase with higher doses of estrogen. This meta-analysis showed that the risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke was 1.6-fold increased in women using COCs . The risk was highest for pills with > 50 microgram estrogen. When combined with the results of studies on the risk of venous thrombosis in COC users, it seems that the COC pill containing levonorgestrel and 30 µg of estrogen is the safest oral form of combined oral hormonal contraception.","In total, 28 articles on 24 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. Our results showed that the overall risk of arterial thrombosis was was 1.6-fold increased in women using oral contraceptive pills compared with women who did not use oral contraceptive pills. The risk did not vary clearly according to progestagen type. However, we found that the risk of arterial thrombosis seemed to be twice as high in women taking pills with higher doses of estrogen. Also, the risk of other side effects of oral contraceptive pills (such as a blood clot in a vein-venous thrombosis) should be considered before any type of oral contraceptive pill is prescribed. It is likely that the COC pill containing levonorgestrel and 30 µg of estrogen is the safest oral form of combined oral hormonal contraception. The overall quality of evidence in this review was moderate. Most studies (22 out of 28) correctly confirmed that patients had been diagnosed with arterial thrombosis. However, only four studies also checked that the type of pill a patient had been using was reported correctly. In addition, only half of the studies ensured that the correct comparisons were made between patients with and patients without arterial thrombosis. Also of importance is the fact that the analysis on progestagen type was based on few studies only."
CD010306,"Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster-randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped-wedge design. Changing task characteristics
One study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task-based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from -3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low-quality evidence). Changing organisational characteristics
Two studies compared teacher training combined with school-wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job-related anxiety (MD -0.25 95% CI -0.61 to 0.11, very low-quality evidence) or depression (MD -0.26 95% CI -0.57 to 0.05, very low-quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD -0.05 95% CI -0.52 to 0.42, low-quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI -0.11 to 0.33, low-quality evidence) after six months. Multi-component intervention
One study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi-component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched-comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow-up, very low-quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias. We found low-quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex-interventions framework, use a cluster-randomised design and have large sample sizes.","We found four studies that included a total of 2199 teachers. They evaluated three types of work changes. One intervention consisted of changes in teachers' tasks such as redesigning work, establishing flexible work schedules and redesigning the work environment. Another intervention consisted of a school-wide coaching support network alongside individual training for teachers, in order to deliver a child development programme. The third intervention consisted of several components: performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. Changes in tasks of teachers
In one study with 961 teachers in eight schools, changes in tasks of teachers combined with stress management training resulted in a small reduction in work stress levels after one year follow-up compared to no intervention. There was also a small increase in work ability, meaning how well a worker is able to perform his or her work. However, the authors did not report how they changed teachers' tasks, limiting the results' usefulness elsewhere. Changing organisational features
There were two studies of school-wide coaching support combined with teacher training. In one study with 43 schools and 59 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on anxiety or depression after two years follow-up compared to no intervention. In the other study with 18 schools and 77 participating teachers, there was no considerable effect on burnout or emotional ability after six months follow-up compared to no intervention. Burnout is a state of prolonged severe stress. Emotional ability means understanding other people’s emotions, and understanding and controlling ones own emotions. Both studies had a small number of participants. Multicomponent programme
In one study with 34 schools and 1102 teachers, the intervention included performance bonus pay, job promotion opportunities and mentoring. After three years follow-up and compared to 300 similar schools, there was a moderate reduction in resignation of teachers in the intervention schools. However, authors reported results only for eight schools. The quality of the evidence was low for all interventions because the authors did not report all the results and lost many participants for follow-up. All included studies also had interventions directed at individual teachers combined with changes at schools. Therefore, new and better quality studies directed at schools will probably change the conclusions of this review. Changing the way teachers' work is organised at schools may improve the teachers' wellbeing and may reduce teacher resignations. We need better-designed research in the development and testing of work changes in schools. In future studies, whether work at schools is changed or not should be determined according to chance. These studies should also have several hundred participants."
CD004571,"Five randomised or quasi-randomised double-blind trials fulfilled the selection criteria, but were not sufficiently comparable to undertake a meta-analysis. The drugs studied were verapamil (8 participants), diltiazem (56 participants), nifedipine (105 participants) and flunarizine (27 participants). There were limitations in the description of blinding and randomisation, and definition of outcome measures. One trial, using verapamil, showed a difference between groups in muscle force measured by ergometry, but also revealed cardiac side effects. The numbers of people included in the trials were low, and so the studies may not have included enough people for sufficient power to detect small differences in muscle force or function between placebo and control groups. In addition, calcium antagonists were in an early stage of development and some of the second generation drugs that have a better side effect profile, such as amlodipine, have not been studied. There is no evidence to show a significant beneficial effect of calcium antagonists on muscle function in DMD.","This is an updated review. In the original review original eight studies were identified and five were high enough quality to be included. In this update no new trials were identified and so five were still included in the review. These studies were of different types of calcium channel blocking drugs and measured a variety of outcomes such as muscle strength, scales of muscle function, biochemical changes in muscle and electrocardiographic findings. Only one study showed a beneficial effect, which was an increase in muscle strength, but in this study the drug used was also associated with cardiac side effects. Adverse effects noted were mostly known side effects of calcium channel blockers. Limitations of the review were that a meta-analysis could not be done as the trials used different calcium channel blockers and measured different outcomes, and all but one of the trials included a low number of patients. In conclusion, the review did not find calcium antagonists to have a useful effect."
CD010525,"We did not identify any eligible new studies for this update. Two studies with a combined total of 288 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Unfractionated heparin compared to low molecular weight heparin
One study compared unfractionated heparin with low molecular weight heparin and found no evidence of a difference between the treatments in the prevention of DVT (odds ratio (OR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 5.35; 75 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No bleeding events occurred in either group. Deaths and adverse events were not reported. This study was open-label and therefore at a high risk of performance bias. Additionally, the study did not report the method of randomisation, so the risk of selection bias was unclear. Heparin compared to placebo
In the second study, there was no evidence of a benefit from heparin use in preventing PE when compared to placebo (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.01; 134 participants; low-certainty evidence). Similarly, no evidence of improvement was detected when the level of amputation was considered, with a similar incidence of PE between the two treatment groups: above knee amputation (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.97; 94 participants; low-certainty evidence); and below knee amputation (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.09 to 26.43; 40 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ten participants died during the study; five underwent a post-mortem and three were found to have had a recent PE, all of whom had been on placebo (low-certainty evidence). Bleeding events were reported in less than 10% of participants in both treatment groups, but the study did not present specific data (low-certainty evidence). There were no reports of other adverse events. This study did not report the methods used to conceal allocation of treatment, so it was unclear whether selection bias occurred. However, this study appeared to be free from all other sources of bias. No study looked at mechanical prophylaxis. We did not identify any eligible new studies for this update. As we only included two studies in this review, each comparing different interventions, there is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding the most effective thromboprophylaxis regimen in people undergoing lower limb amputation. Further large-scale studies of good quality are required.","This review was first published in 2013, and we searched for any studies that have taken place since then (up to 5 November 2019). We did not find any eligible new studies for this update. The review includes the original two studies with a combined total of 288 participants. One study compared two forms of the anticoagulant heparin. We found no evidence of a difference between unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin in the prevention of DVT. None of the participants reported any bleeding. However, in this study both the participants and study personnel were aware of which treatment was being administered. This may have biased the results. It is unclear if other bias was introduced because the study did not adequately describe the process of randomly allocating treatment. The second study found no evidence of a benefit for heparin compared with placebo in preventing a PE, whether the amputation was above or below the knee. Bleeding occurred in less than 10% of each treatment group, but the study authors did not report specific numbers and therefore we could not analyse this. This study did not report the methods used to conceal how treatment was allocated, but we judged it to be free from other sources of bias. This review found that there are too few trials to determine the most effective strategy in preventing VTE in people undergoing amputation of the lower limb. No study looked at mechanical forms of preventing VTE, such as compression devices, and therefore it is not possible to make any conclusions about these. Further good quality and large-scale studies are required. The certainty of the evidence provided by these studies is very low for the comparison of unfractionated heparin against low molecular weight heparin, and low for the comparison of heparin against placebo. We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to the small size and low number of studies, and concerns over the methods used (risk of bias). Further larger studies are required to determine optimal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in people undergoing major lower extremity amputation."
CD011961,"Seven studies with a total of 225 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. All seven studies compared the effects of a cognitive training intervention to a control intervention at the end of treatment periods lasting four to eight weeks. Six studies included people with PD living in the community. These six studies recruited people with single-domain (executive) or multiple-domain mild cognitive impairment in PD. Four of these studies identified participants with MCI using established diagnostic criteria, and two included both people with PD-MCI and people with PD who were not cognitively impaired. One study recruited people with a diagnosis of PD dementia who were living in long-term care settings. The cognitive training intervention in three studies targeted a single cognitive domain, whilst in four studies multiple domains of cognitive function were targeted. The comparison groups either received no intervention or took part in recreational activities (sports, music, arts), speech or language exercises, computerised motor therapy, or motor rehabilitation combined with recreational activity. We found no clear evidence that cognitive training improved global cognition. Although cognitive training was associated with higher scores on global cognition at the end of treatment, the result was imprecise and not statistically significant (6 trials, 178 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.03 to 0.59; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference at the end of treatment between cognitive training and control interventions on executive function (5 trials, 112 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.48; low-certainty evidence) or visual processing (3 trials, 64 participants; SMD 0.30, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.81; low-certainty evidence). The evidence favoured the cognitive training group on attention (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.68; low-certainty evidence) and verbal memory (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.69; low-certainty evidence), but these effects were less certain in sensitivity analyses that excluded a study in which only a minority of the sample were cognitively impaired. There was no evidence of differences between treatment and control groups in activities of daily living (3 trials, 67 participants; SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.47 to 0.53; low-certainty evidence) or quality of life (5 trials, 147 participants; SMD −0.01, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence). There was very little information on adverse events. We considered the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to be low due to risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the results. We identified six ongoing trials recruiting participants with PD-MCI, but no ongoing trials of cognitive training for people with PDD. This review found no evidence that people with PD-MCI or PDD who receive cognitive training for four to eight weeks experience any important cognitive improvements at the end of training. However, this conclusion was based on a small number of studies with few participants, limitations of study design and execution, and imprecise results. There is a need for more robust, adequately powered studies of cognitive training before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of cognitive training for people with PDD and PD-MCI. Studies should use formal criteria to diagnose cognitive impairments, and there is a particular need for more studies testing the efficacy of cognitive training in people with PDD.","We found seven studies that randomly allocated a total of 225 participants to cognitive training or to a control group. Treatment lasted from four to eight weeks. All the cognitive training interventions were delivered by computer. The control groups received either no intervention or a control intervention such as language or motor exercises or participation in recreational activities. We found no difference between people who received cognitive training and people in the control groups in global cognition shortly after treatment ended. There was no convincing evidence of benefit in specific cognitive skills and no benefit shown in activities of daily living or quality of life. However, these findings were based on a small number of participants in a small number of studies. The overall certainty of the evidence was low, meaning that the results of further research could differ from the results of this review. We found no good evidence that cognitive training is helpful for people with Parkinson's disease and dementia or MCI. The included studies were small and had flaws that may have affected the findings. The certainty of the results was low, and further studies are needed before we can be confident whether or not cognitive training is effective for this group of people."
CD010283,"Seven randomised trials were included, four of which reported usable data on 472 children with asthma one to 18 years of age who were admitted to paediatric wards. No trials included patients admitted to the ICU. The anticholinergic used, ipratropium bromide 250 μg, was given every one to eight hours over a period from four hours to the entire length of the hospital stay. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. The addition of anticholinergics to β2-agonists showed no evidence of effect on the duration of hospital admission (mean difference (MD) -0.28 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.07 to 4.52, 3 studies, 327 participants, moderate quality evidence) and no serious or non-serious adverse events were reported in any included trials. As a result of the similarity of trials, we could not explore the influence of age, admission site, intensity of anticholinergic treatment and co-interventions on primary outcomes. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other secondary outcomes, including the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short-acting β2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason. In children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, no evidence of benefit for length of hospital stay and other markers of response to therapy was noted when nebulised anticholinergics were added to short-acting β2-agonists. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevent firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in ICUs, no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with impending respiratory failure. These findings support current national and international recommendations indicating that healthcare practitioners should refrain from using anticholinergics in children hospitalised for acute asthma.","In reviewing evidence available until November 2013, we found seven eligible studies of children hospitalised with acute asthma; four of these studies (472 children one to 18 years of age) contributed data to the review. Four studies compared the combination of anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide) and beta2-agonists versus the same dose of beta2-agonists alone. Included studies enrolled both girls and boys, with a gender ratio ranging from 59% to 73% males. No additional benefit was noted by adding anticholinergics to β2-agonists in terms of duration of hospital stay in patients compared to those who received beta2-agonists alone. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. No trial reported information on serious adverse events. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other markers of response to therapy, that is, the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short-acting beta2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason. No apparent benefit is derived from adding anticholinergics to beta2-agonists in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, that is, beyond initial treatment in the emergency department. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevents firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU), no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with very severe exacerbations who are admitted to the ICU. Our findings support the ongoing recommendations provided by national and international guidelines. This review is based on a small number of identified trials conducted in children with acute asthma. All trials contributing to the primary outcome are of high methodological quality, but they are few. As the addition of new trials may change the conclusion, the quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate. Additional and larger trials are needed."
CD005562,"We included 37 RCTs (with 2766 participants), 26 published since the previous update. Most evaluated CS groups; eight examined individual CS. Participants' median age was 79.7 years. Sixteen studies included participants resident in care homes or hospitals. Study quality showed indications of improvement since the previous review, with few areas of high risk of bias. Assessors were clearly blinded to treatment allocation in most studies (81%) and most studies (81%) reported use of a treatment manual by those delivering the intervention. However, in a substantial number of studies (59%), we could not find details on all aspects of the randomisation procedures, leading us to rate the risk of selection bias as unclear. We entered data in the meta-analyses from 36 studies (2704 participants; CS: 1432, controls: 1272). The primary analysis was on changes evident immediately following the treatment period (median length 10 weeks; range 4 to 52 weeks). Only eight studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether effects were subsequently maintained (four at 6- to 12-week follow-up; four at 8- to 12-month follow-up). No negative effects were reported. Overall, we found moderate-quality evidence for a small benefit in cognition associated with CS (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). In the 25 studies, with 1893 participants, reporting the widely used MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) test for cognitive function in dementia, there was moderate-quality evidence of a clinically important difference of 1.99 points between CS and controls (95% CI: 1.24, 2.74). In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, again examining the difference between CS and controls on changes immediately following the intervention period, we found moderate-quality evidence of a slight improvement in self-reported QoL (18 studies, 1584 participants; SMD: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.42]) as well as in QoL ratings made by proxies (staff or caregivers). We found high-quality evidence for clinically relevant improvements in staff/interviewer ratings of communication and social interaction (5 studies, 702 participants; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.70]) and for slight benefits in instrumental Activities of Daily Living, self-reported depressed mood, staff/interviewer-rated anxiety and general behaviour rating scales. We found moderate-quality evidence for slight improvements in behaviour that challenges and in basic Activities of Daily Living and low-quality evidence for a slight improvement in staff/interviewer-rated depressed mood. A few studies reported a range of outcomes for family caregivers. We found moderate-quality evidence that overall CS made little or no difference to caregivers' mood or anxiety. We found a high level of inconsistency between studies in relation to both cognitive outcomes and QoL. In exploratory subgroup analyses, we did not identify an effect of modality (group versus individual) or, for group studies, of setting (community versus care home), total number of group sessions or type of control condition (treatment-as-usual versus active controls). However, we did find improvements in cognition were larger where group sessions were more frequent (twice weekly or more versus once weekly) and where average severity of dementia among participants at the start of the intervention was 'mild' rather than 'moderate'. Imbalance in numbers of studies and participants between subgroups and residual inconsistency requires these exploratory findings to be interpreted cautiously. In this updated review, now with a much more extensive evidence base, we have again identified small, short-term cognitive benefits for people with mild to moderate dementia participating in CS programmes. From a smaller number of studies, we have also found clinically relevant improvements in communication and social interaction and slight benefits in a range of outcomes including QoL, mood and behaviour that challenges. There are relatively few studies of individual CS, and further research is needed to delineate the effectiveness of different delivery methods (including digital and remote, individual and group) and of multi-component programmes. We have identified that the frequency of group sessions and level of dementia severity may influence the outcomes of CS, and these aspects should be studied further. There remains an evidence gap in relation to the potential benefits of longer-term CS programmes and their clinical significance.","We wanted to find out if CS was better for people living with dementia than usual care or unstructured social activities to improve:
- cognitive abilities (including memory, thinking and language skills)
- well-being and mood
- day-to-day abilities
- distress and upset for the person with dementia and/or carers
We also wanted to find out if family carers experienced any changes associated with the person with dementia receiving CS or if there were any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that looked at group or individual CS compared with usual care or unstructured social activity in people living with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 37 studies involving 2766 participants with mild or moderate dementia and an average age of 79 years. The biggest study involved 356 participants, the smallest 13. The studies were conducted in 17 countries from five continents, with most in Europe. Fewer than half (16) included participants living in care homes or hospitals. The length of the trials varied from four weeks to two years. Sessions per week varied from one to six. The overall number of sessions varied from eight to 520. Most studies lasted for around 10 weeks, with around 20 sessions. Most studies offered CS in groups, with just eight examining individual CS. No negative effects were reported. We found that CS probably results in a small benefit to cognition at the end of the course of sessions compared with usual care/unstructured activities. This benefit equates roughly to a six-month delay in the cognitive decline usually expected in mild-to-moderate dementia. We found preliminary evidence suggesting that cognition benefited more when group sessions occurred twice weekly or more (rather than once weekly) and that benefits were greater in studies where participants’ dementia at the outset was of mild severity. We also found that participants improved on measures of communication and social interaction and showed slight benefits in day-to-day activities and in their own ratings of their mood. There is probably also a slight improvement in participants’ well-being and in experiences that are upsetting and distressing for people with dementia and carers. We found CS probably made little or no difference to carers' mood or anxiety. Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about differences in results between studies. We cannot be certain of the exact reasons for these differences, but we noted that studies varied in:
• the way CS was delivered (individually, in groups, using an app) and the programme of activities included
• who delivered the programme (trained professionals, care workers, family carers)
• the frequency of sessions (1 per week to 5 per week)
• the duration of the programme (from 4 weeks to 1 or 2 years)
• the type(s) of dementia with which participants were diagnosed and the severity of the dementia
• whether participants lived in care homes and hospitals or in their own homes
We were unable to examine as many of these sources of potential difference as would have been desirable because of the relatively small number of studies reflecting each aspect. This review updates our previous review from 2012, with evidence up-to-date to March 2022."
CD002088,"We included five small trials that randomised a total of 234 participants. Two studies were assessed as low risk of bias; none of the included studies were adequately powered. Two studies used an attention control and three studies compared to an alternative intervention, which in all cases was one intervention versus usual care intervention. The searches we carried out did not find any trials comparing an intervention with no intervention. The searches did not find any trials of an intervention that compared variations in timing, dose, or intensity of treatment using the same intervention. Four studies included only people with stroke; one included mostly people with stroke, but also those with brain injury. Three studies delivered interventions in the first few months after stroke; two recruited people with chronic dysarthria. Three studies evaluated behavioural interventions, one investigated acupuncture and another transcranial magnetic stimulation. One study included people with dysarthria within a broader trial of people with impaired communication. Our primary analysis of a persisting (three to nine months post-intervention) effect at the activity level of measurement found no evidence in favour of dysarthria intervention compared with any control (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.55; 3 trials, 116 participants, GRADE: low quality, I² = 0%). Findings from sensitivity analysis of studies at low risk of bias were similar, with a slightly wider confidence interval and low heterogeneity (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.73, I² = 32%; 2 trials, 92 participants, GRADE: low quality). Subgroup analysis results for stroke were similar to the primary analysis because few non-stroke participants had been recruited to trials (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.54, I² = 0%; 3 trials, 106 participants, GRADE: low quality). Similar results emerged from most of the secondary analyses. There was no evidence of a persisting effect at the impairment (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.06, I² = 70%; 2 trials, 56 participants, GRADE: very low quality) or participation level (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.33, I² = 0%; 2 trials, 79 participants, GRADE: low quality) but substantial heterogeneity on the former. Analyses of immediate post-intervention outcomes provided no evidence of any short-term benefit on activity (SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.66, I² = 0%; 3 trials, 117 participants, GRADE: very low quality); or participation (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.45; 1 study, 32 participants) levels of measurement. There was a statistically significant effect favouring intervention at the immediate, impairment level of measurement (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, P = 0.04, I² = 0%; 4 trials, 99 participants, GRADE: very low quality) but only one of these four trials had a low risk of bias. We found no definitive, adequately powered RCTs of interventions for people with dysarthria. We found limited evidence to suggest there may be an immediate beneficial effect on impairment level measures; more, higher quality research is needed to confirm this finding. Although we evaluated five studies, the benefits and risks of interventions remain unknown and the emerging evidence justifies the need for adequately powered clinical trials into this condition. People with dysarthria after stroke or brain injury should continue to receive rehabilitation according to clinical guidelines.","We included five small trials that randomised only 234 people, almost all with stroke. Two trials investigated dysarthria treatment versus an attention control and three compared one treatment with usual care. There were no trials that compared one treatment to no treatment. We found few randomised controlled trials of dysarthria treatment, and those that have been conducted involved small numbers of participants, or were not adequately designed or had serious reporting flaws. We compared many different measures at various time points after treatment, so caution is recommended when interpreting results. We found no evidence of effectiveness on most measures, including long-lasting improvement in every day communication abilities. A positive finding was short-term improvement in muscle movement, such as tongue and lip control. However, this result is not reliable because it was based on small numbers of people, and we found concerns about the conduct and reporting of some trials. This finding needs to be investigated in a bigger, better designed trial. We found insufficient evidence to tell us whether any one treatment is better than any other or whether treatment is better than general support, or no treatment. We found no studies that examined timing, duration, or intensity of treatment. This is a clinically important question and should be considered in future trials. The included trials varied in quality but all included small numbers of participants. Overall, studies were rated as low to very low quality evidence."
CD013879,"We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI’s critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI’s checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5
We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%)  are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%). This systematic literature review indicates that cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in people who are hospitalised with a COVID-19 infection, and cardiovascular complications are frequent. We plan to update this review and to conduct a formal meta-analysis of outcomes based on a more homogeneous selected subsample of high-certainty studies.","We found 220 studies that reported relevant information, but the quality of the information was often poor. Studies were mostly from China and the USA. Most studies only had information on the small minority of cases that were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, often to the intensive care unit. We found that high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease are very common in people hospitalised with COVID-19 and are associated with an increased risk of death. More than one-third of patients with COVID-19 had a history of high blood pressure, 23.5% had a pre-existing heart or blood vessel problem, 22.1% had diabetes, and 21.6% were obese (many people had more than one of these conditions). The most common cardiovascular complication in people with COVID-19 was an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation; 8.5%). Blood clots in the legs (6.1%) or lungs (4.3%), and heart failure (6.8%) were also common, but the reported rates may be underestimated because the studies did not always carry out appropriate investigations. Heart attacks (1.7%) and strokes (1.2%) were reported less often. Blood tests also often suggested heart damage or stress. The studies focused on people in hospital, with severe COVID-19, so the results may not apply to people who had milder COVID-19 who were not hospitalised. The studies were very different from each other and did not always report the results in the same way or use the most reliable methods. Accordingly, our confidence in the precision of the prevalence of pre-existing disease and of cardiovascular complications is not high. We plan to update this review. However, in future, we will focus only on higher-quality evidence to increase the strength of our findings."
CD006005,"Four trials, recruiting 136 participants, were included. Two trials compared lamivudine alone versus HBIg alone. Randomisation was performed one week after transplantation in one of the trials and after six months after transplantation in another; from transplantation until randomisation, HBIg alone was given to all patients in the two trials. A third trial compared combination treatment with lamivudine and HBIg versus lamivudine alone after one month of combination treatment, and a fourth trial compared the combination of lamivudine and HBIg versus a combination of lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil after at least 12-month of lamivudine and HBIg combination treatment. Statistically significant differences were not detected in any of the comparisons and outcomes. All trials were open-labelled, and none of the trials were adequately powered to show a difference in HBV recurrence. No meta-analyses were performed since the identified trials assessed different comparisons. This review could not derive clear evidence from randomised clinical trials for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV following liver transplantation for preventing recurrence of HBV infection. Large randomised clinical trials comparing long-term combination treatment to each of the monotherapy alone, including the newer antiviral drugs, are needed.","We found only four randomised clinical trials that compared different prophylactic regimens in 136 participants. None of the trials compared the same prophylaxis regimen. In each individual trial no significant differences were detected with regard to patients' survival after transplantation, HBV recurrence, or the recurrence of liver disease. All trials were too small to detect a difference, if it existed. Prevention of HBV recurrence following liver transplantation is currently non-evidence based. Practice is to administer a combination of HBIg and an antiviral drug. Randomised clinical trials are needed to examine this practice."
CD012707,"We included 10 studies with 78 to 4500 participants and follow-up from 3 to 24 months. Nine studies assessed the effects of EHR with additional functionalities, each addressing a subset of outcomes sought by this review. Five studies focused on patients with diabetes mellitus, four on patients with specific diseases, and one on all patients. All studies compared EHR access alone or with additional functionalities plus usual care versus usual care only. No studies assessing the effects of EHR access alone versus EHR access with additional functionalities were identified. Interventions required a variety of data within the EHR, such as patient history, problem list, medication, allergies, and lab results. In addition to EHR access, eight studies allowed patients to share self-documented data, seven offered individualised disease management functions, seven offered educational disease-related information, six supported secure communication, and one offered preventive reminders. Only two studies were at low or unclear risk of bias across domains. Meta-analysis could not be performed, as participants, interventions, and outcomes were too heterogeneous, and most studies presented results based on different adjustment methods or variables. The quality of evidence was rated as low or very low across outcomes. Overall differences between intervention and control groups, if any, were small. The relevance of any small effects remains unclear for most outcomes because in most cases, trial authors did not define a minimal clinically important difference. Overall, results suggest that the effects of EHR access alone and with additional functionalities are mostly uncertain when compared with usual care. Patient knowledge and understanding: very low-quality evidence is available from one study, so we are uncertain about effects of the intervention on patient knowledge about diabetes and blood glucose testing. Patient empowerment: low-quality evidence from three studies suggests that the intervention may have little or no effect on patient empowerment measures. Patient adherence: low-quality evidence from two studies suggests that the intervention may slightly improve adherence to the process of monitoring risk factors and preventive services. Effects on medication adherence are conflicting in two studies; this may or may not improve to a clinically relevant degree. Patient satisfaction with care: low-quality evidence from three studies suggests that the intervention may have little or no effect on patient satisfaction, with conflicting results. Adverse events: two small studies reported on mortality; one of these also reported on serious and other adverse events, but sample sizes were too small for small differences to be detected. Therefore, low-quality evidence suggests that the intervention may have little to no effect on mortality and other adverse events. Health-related quality of life: only very low-quality evidence from one study is available. We are uncertain whether the intervention improves disease-specific quality of life of patients with asthma. Health-related outcomes: low-quality evidence from eight studies suggests that the intervention may have little to no effect on asthma control, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol levels, body mass index or weight, or 10-year Framingham risk scores. Low-quality evidence from one study suggests that the composite scores of risk factors for diabetes mellitus may improve slightly with the intervention, but there is uncertainty about effects on ophthalmic medications or intraocular pressure. Psychosocial health outcomes: no study investigated psychosocial health outcomes in a more than anecdotal way. Health resource consumption: low-quality evidence for adult patients in three studies suggests that there may be little to no effect of the intervention on different measures of healthcare use. Patient-provider communication: very low-quality evidence is available from a single small study, and we are uncertain whether the intervention improves communication measures, such as the number of messages sent. The effects of EHR access with additional functionalities in comparison with usual care for the most part are uncertain. Only adherence to the process of monitoring risk factors and providing preventive services as well as a composite score of risk factors for diabetes mellitus may improve slightly with EHR access with additional functionalities. Due to inconsistent terminology in this area, our search may have missed relevant studies. As the overall quality of evidence is very low to low, future research is likely to change these results. Further trials should investigate the impact of EHR access in a broader range of countries and clinical settings, including more patients over a longer period of follow-up, as this may increase the likelihood of detecting effects of the intervention, should these exist. More studies should focus on assessing outcomes such as patient empowerment and behavioural outcomes, rather than concentrating on health-related outcomes alone. Future studies should distinguish between effects of EHR access only and effects of additional functionalities, and investigate the impact of mobile EHR tools. Future studies should include information on usage patterns, and consider the potential for widening health inequalities with implementation of EHR access. A taxonomy for EHR access and additional functionalities should be developed to promote consistency and comparability of outcome measures, and facilitate future reviews by better enabling cross-study comparisons.","We found 10 relevant studies, published between 2000 and 2016, that enrolled from 78 to 4500 adults. These studies took place in the USA (seven studies), Canada (two), and Japan (one). Five studies were conducted in doctors' offices and five in hospital clinics. People taking part in the studies were followed up for three months to two years. Two studies were funded in part by pharmaceutical companies. The studies focused on patients with type 2 diabetes (five studies), asthma (one study), glaucoma (one study), congestive heart failure (one study), and hypertension (one study); one study focused on patients who visited their doctor for any reason. Studies compared usual care plus access to electronic health records against usual care alone. In nine studies, access to electronic health records came with extra services. We could not combine study results because of differences in how studies were conducted, types of patients enrolled, and how results were measured, so we had to evaluate them separately. Compared with usual care, we are uncertain whether access to electronic health records affected:
1. patients' knowledge and understanding of diabetes and of blood glucose testing (evidence from one study in 379 patients with diabetes); or
2. how often patients communicated with their healthcare provider (one study in 107 patients). Compared with usual care, access to electronic health records may make little to no difference in:
1. patients feeling empowered (three studies; 601 patients) or satisfied with their care (three studies; 903 patients); or
2. how many patients died or reported serious unwanted effects (two studies; 486 patients). Four studies (in 5466 patients) looked at how well patients kept up with monitoring programmes and continued to take their medicines. Although access to electronic health records may slightly improve keeping up with monitoring programmes, studies assessing how patients continued to take their medications showed different results, so we are unclear about effects of the intervention. Accessing electronic health records may not have affected how often patients used healthcare services (three studies). No studies reported on any unwanted effects nor on whether access to health records may have affected patients' anxiety, worry, or depression. We are not confident in our results because of the small number of studies found. Our search may have missed some relevant studies because of differences in terms used for electronic health records. In addition, we identified limitations in the ways most studies were designed or conducted. Further evidence is likely to change our results. Access to electronic health records (and extra services) may provide little to no benefit for patients' feelings of empowerment or satisfaction, nor for risk factors for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and high pressure inside the eye (a risk factor for glaucoma). Such access may slightly increase how many patients keep up with monitoring for risk factors. Future studies should use up-to-date technologies such as mobile devices to find out:
1. effects of access to electronic health records;
2. for which groups of patients access is most suitable; and
3. which extra services should be included."
CD007654,"This third update of the review added one new trial, investigating the combination of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo. Two medications, which were included in the previous versions of this review (rimonabant and sibutramine) are no longer considered relevant for this update, since their marketing approval was withdrawn in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The number of included studies in this review update is therefore six (12,724 participants in total): four RCTs comparing orlistat to placebo, involving a total of 3132 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 46 to 55 years; one trial comparing phentermine/topiramate to placebo, involving 1305 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 53 years; and one trial comparing naltrexone/bupropion to placebo, involving 8283 participants with hypertension and a mean age of 62 years. We judged the risks of bias to be unclear for the trials investigating orlistat or naltrexone/bupropion. and low for the trial investigating phentermine/topiramate. Only the study of naltrexone/bupropion included cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as predefined outcomes. There were no differences in the rates of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo. The incidence of overall adverse events was significantly higher in participants treated with naltrexone/bupropion. For orlistat, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher compared to placebo. The most frequent side effects with phentermine/topiramate were dry mouth and paraesthesia. After six to 12 months, orlistat reduced systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by mean difference (MD) −2.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) −3.8 to −1.4 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants) and diastolic blood pressure by MD −2.0 mm Hg (95% CI −2.7 to −1.2 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants). After 13 months of follow-up, phentermine/topiramate decreased systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by −2.0 to −4.2 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage), and diastolic blood pressure by −1.3 to −1.9 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage). There was no difference in the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo (1 trial, 8283 participants). We identified no relevant studies investigating liraglutide or lorcaserin in people with hypertension. In people with elevated blood pressure, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion reduced body weight; the magnitude of the effect was greatest with phentermine/topiramate. In the same trials, orlistat and phentermine/topiramate, but not naltrexone/bupropion, reduced blood pressure. One RCT of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo showed no differences in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity after two years. The European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorisation for phentermine/topiramate due to safety concerns, while for lorcaserin the application for European marketing authorisation was withdrawn due to a negative overall benefit/risk balance. In 2020 lorcaserin was also withdrawn from the US market. Two other medications (rimonabant and sibutramine) had already been withdrawn from the market in 2009 and 2010, respectively.","We found six studies in 12,724 people with high blood pressure (average age 46 to 62 years). The studies were conducted in the USA (3 studies) and Europe (3 studies), and lasted from 6 months to 28 months. All studies compared the effects of taking a weight-loss medicine with effects of taking a dummy medicine (placebo). Orlistat may reduce weight and probably reduces blood pressure (4 studies; 2058 people). Phentermine plus topiramate may reduce weight and may reduce blood pressure (1 study; 1305 people). Naltrexone plus bupropion probably reduces weight but probably does not reduce blood pressure (1 study; 8283 people). One study looked at the risk of death and major unwanted cardiovascular effects; it showed no differences between naltrexone plus bupropion treatment and a placebo after two years. People taking weight-loss medicines reported more unwanted effects than those taking a placebo. The most common unwanted effects were digestive problems (for orlistat, and phentermine plus topiramate), dry mouth and skin tingling or numbness (for naltrexone plus bupropion). Results are from a small number of studies. In some studies, there were few events for some measures we were interested in. We are moderately confident about how orlistat and naltrexone plus bupropion affected weight loss and blood pressure. However, results might change if more evidence becomes available. We are less confident about the effects of phentermine plus topiramate; the unwanted effects of orlistat, and the risk of unwanted cardiovascular events associated with naltrexone plus bupropion. Results are likely to change if more evidence becomes available. Some weight-loss medicines reduce weight and blood pressure in people with high blood pressure, but may cause unwanted effects. We did not find enough evidence about whether taking weight-loss medicines to lose weight could reduce death and cardiovascular disease."
CD001775,"Two published trials were identified that randomised a total of 119 people. In one study conducted in France, 20 people were randomly allocated to Gingko biloba extract EGb 761 80 mg twice daily or placebo. In the other study conducted in Germany, 99 people were randomly allocated to two different doses of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 (240 mg per day and 60 mg per day). Treatment duration in both studies was six months. Both trials reported some positive effects of Ginkgo biloba on vision however their results could not be pooled. Adverse effects and quality of life for people with AMD were not reported. The question as to whether people with AMD should take Ginkgo biloba extract to prevent progression of the disease has not been answered by research to date. Two small trials have suggested possible benefit of Gingko biloba on vision and further trials are warranted. Ginkgo biloba is widely used in China, Germany, and France. Future trials should be larger, and last longer, in order to provide a more robust measure of the effect of Gingko biloba extract on AMD.","The author identified two small randomised controlled studies (with a total of 119 participants); one in France and one in Germany. One trial compared Gingko biloba to placebo and the other compared two different doses of the extract. Although both trials reported some positive effects of Ginkgo biloba on vision, the trials were small and of short duration. Adverse effects and quality of life were not assessed. The overall conclusion of this review is that current research has not answered the question as to whether Ginkgo biloba is of benefit to people with AMD. Future trials need to include a larger number of participants and be conducted over a longer time."
CD008984,"We included 35 trials (13,872 adult participants). Seven included studies were at low risk of bias. We identified eight studies as awaiting classification since we could not obtain the full texts, and had insufficient information to include or exclude them. We included data from 24 trials for quantitative synthesis. The results of meta-analyses showed that nitrous oxide-based techniques increased the incidence of pulmonary atelectasis (odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 2.10, P = 0.002), but had no effects on the inhospital case fatality rate, the incidence of pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, severe nausea and vomiting, venous thromboembolism, wound infection, or the length of hospital stay. The sensitivity analyses suggested that the results of the meta-analyses were all robust except for the outcomes of pneumonia, and severe nausea and vomiting. Two trials reported length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay but the data were skewed so were not pooled. Both trials reported that nitrous oxide-based techniques had no effects on the length of ICU stay. We rated the quality of evidence for two outcomes (pulmonary atelectasis, myocardial infarction) as high, four outcomes (inhospital case fatality rate, stroke, venous thromboembolism, length of hospital stay) as moderate, and three (pneumonia, severe nausea and vomiting, wound infection rate) as low. Given the evidence from this Cochrane review, the avoidance of nitrous oxide may be reasonable in participants with pre-existing poor pulmonary function or at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Since there are eight studies awaiting classification, selection bias may exist in our systematic review.","We examined the evidence available up to 17 October 2014. We included 35 trials involving 13,872 adult participants, all of whom were randomized to either receive nitrous oxide or no nitrous oxide. The trials covered a variety of situations during general anaesthesia. We found that general anaesthesia with nitrous oxide increased the risk of pulmonary atelectasis (i.e. failure of the lungs to expand fully). When we restricted the results to the highest quality studies only, we found evidence that nitrous oxide may potentially increase the risk of pneumonia and severe nausea and vomiting. However, nitrous oxide had no effect on the patients' survival, the incidence of heart attack, stroke, wound infection, the occurrence of blood clots within veins, the length of hospital stay, or the length of intensive care unit stay. The evidence related to survival of participants was of moderate quality because we did not have enough data. The evidence related to some harmful effects, such as failure of the lungs to expand fully and heart attack, was of high quality, while for other harmful effects, such as stroke and the occurrence of blood clots within veins, the evidence was of moderate quality. For others, such as pneumonia, severe nausea and vomiting, and wound infection, the evidence was of low quality. The evidence related to the length of time spend in hospital was of moderate quality. The avoidance of nitrous oxide may be reasonable in participants with pre-existing poor pulmonary function or at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting."
CD008860,"We included three trials (four interventions) involving 196 participants with stroke and co-morbid anxiety. One trial (described as a 'pilot study') randomised 21 community-dwelling stroke survivors to four-week use of a relaxation CD or to wait list control. This trial assessed anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported a reduction in anxiety at three months among participants who had used the relaxation CD (mean (standard deviation (SD) 6.9 (± 4.9) and 11.0 (± 3.9)), Cohen's d = 0.926, P value = 0.001; 19 participants analysed). The second trial randomised 81 participants with co-morbid anxiety and depression to paroxetine, paroxetine plus psychotherapy, or standard care. Mean levels of anxiety severity scores based on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) at follow-up were 5.4 (SD ± 1.7), 3.8 (SD ± 1.8), and 12.8 (SD ± 1.9), respectively (P value < 0.01). The third trial randomised 94 stroke patients, also with co-morbid anxiety and depression, to receive buspirone hydrochloride or standard care. At follow-up, the mean levels of anxiety based on the HAM-A were 6.5 (SD ± 3.1) and 12.6 (SD ± 3.4) in the two groups, respectively, which represents a significant difference (P value < 0.01). Half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced adverse events that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness; however, only 14% of those receiving buspirone experienced nausea or palpitations. Trial authors provided no information about the duration of symptoms associated with adverse events. The trial of relaxation therapy reported no adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low. Each study included a small number of participants, particularly the study of relaxation therapy. Studies of pharmacological agents presented details too limited to allow judgement of selection, performance, and detection bias and lack of placebo treatment in control groups. Although the study of relaxation therapy had allocated participants to treatment using an adequate method of randomisation, study recruitment methods might have introduced bias, and drop-outs in the intervention group may have influenced results. Evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Further well-conducted randomised controlled trials (using placebo or attention controls) are required to assess pharmacological agents and psychological therapies.","Evidence is current to January 2017. We found three studies with 196 stroke survivors who had received a diagnosis of anxiety. One study assessed the effect of a relaxation CD used five times a week for one month for participants with a diagnosis of anxiety. Two studies assessed the use of antidepressants in participants who had both anxiety and depression. One study found that participants were less anxious three months after using a relaxation CD when compared with those who were given no therapy. One study reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant medicine (paroxetine), or with paroxetine and psychotherapy, than with standard care. This study reported that half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced side effects that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. The third study also reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant (buspirone hydrochloride) than with standard care, and only 14% of those receiving buspirone hydrocholoride reported nausea or palpitations. We judged that the quality of this evidence was very low. Studies were few and each included a small number of participants. Studies assessing antidepressants did not include comparison with a placebo drug, and information in both study reports was insufficient to permit assessment of whether other biases had been introduced. The study of relaxation therapy was very small, with loss of two participants who used the CD, and the study recruitment process may have attracted participants who had a positive bias towards psychological therapies. Current evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Additional well-conducted randomised trials are needed."
CD000406,"We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI -0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (-0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro-intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post-treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short-term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long-term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.","This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children. Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or long-term care for adults with cystic fibrosis. One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials. We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many post-treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality."
CD007161,"We included 48 RCTs in the review. Of these, we assessed one as at low risk of bias, 12 as at high risk of bias and 35 as at unclear risk of bias. The results indicated a greater reduction in gingival recession for subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) + coronally advanced flap (CAF) compared to guided tissue regeneration with resorbable membranes (GTR rm) + CAF (MD -0.37 mm; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.13, P = 0.002; 3 studies; 98 participants; low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in gingival recession reduction between acellular dermal matrix grafts (ADMG) + CAF and SCTG + CAF or between enamel matrix protein (EMP) + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Regarding clinical attachment level changes, GTR rm + CAF promoted additional gains compared to SCTG + CAF (MD 0.35; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.63, P = 0.02; 3 studies; 98 participants; low-quality evidence) but there was insufficient evidence of a difference between ADMG + CAF and SCTG + CAF or between EMP + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Greater gains in the keratinized tissue were found for SCTG + CAF when compared to EMP + CAF (MD -1.06 mm; 95% CI -1.36 to -0.76, P < 0.00001; 2 studies; 62 participants; low-quality evidence), and SCTG + CAF when compared to GTR rm + CAF (MD -1.77 mm; 95% CI -2.66 to -0.89, P < 0.0001; 3 studies; 98 participants; very low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in keratinized tissue gain between ADMG + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Few data exist on aesthetic condition change related to patients' opinion and patients' preference for a specific procedure. Subepithelial connective tissue grafts, coronally advanced flap alone or associated with other biomaterial and guided tissue regeneration may be used as root coverage procedures for treating localised or multiple recession-type defects. The available evidence base indicates that in cases where both root coverage and gain in the width of keratinized tissue are expected, the use of subepithelial connective tissue grafts shows a slight improvement in outcome. There is also some weak evidence suggesting that acellular dermal matrix grafts appear as the soft tissue substitute that may provide the most similar outcomes to those achieved by subepithelial connective tissue grafts. RCTs are necessary to identify possible factors associated with the prognosis of each RCPPS procedure. The potential impact of bias on these outcomes is unclear.","Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 15 January 2018. A total of 48 randomised controlled trials on 1227 adults were included with five studies evaluating multiple recession-type defects and the rest single gingival recessions. Most trials followed participants for 6 months to 12 months. The review looked at different interventions: free gingival grafts (FGG), coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone or associated to acellular dermal matrix grafts (ADMG), enamel matrix protein (EMP), guided tissue regeneration with resorbable membranes (GTR rm), guided tissue regeneration with non-resorbable membranes (GTR nrm), GTR rm associated with bone substitutes, platelet-rich plasma or fibrin (PRP or PRF), growth factors (rhPDGF-BB) associated to bone substitutes (b-TCP), subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) or xenogeneic collagen matrix (XCM). We did not find any trials evaluating laterally positioned flaps (LPF). The results of this review have shown that most root coverage periodontal plastic surgery procedures led to gains in reduction of gingival recession. However, we are uncertain about which intervention is the most effective as all studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias. Preferably, subepithelial connective tissue grafts, coronally advanced flap alone or associated with another graft or biomaterial and guided tissue regeneration can be used as root coverage procedures for treating recession-type defects. Limited data exist on how these interventions affect the appearance of the teeth. Adverse effects reported in the studies included discomfort and pain, but these were mainly related to the site where the tissue graft was taken, and occurred mainly within the first week after surgery with no influence on root coverage outcomes. Further research is needed on the results to be achieved from each root coverage periodontal plastic procedure. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low mainly due to problems with the design of the studies."
CD007030,"We retrieved 12,490 citations, obtained full texts for 58 studies and included 12 trials (three from the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 participants. Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions: a fatigue education programme and a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme). The fatigue severity was lower in the intervention groups than in the control groups (244 participants, pooled SMD -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.93 to -0.21), with significant heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 87%, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value < 0.00001). The beneficial effect was not seen in trials that had used adequate allocation concealment (two trials, 89 participants, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.04) or trials that had used adequate blinding of outcome assessors (four trials, 198 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -2.31 to 0.11). No trial primarily investigated the efficacy in preventing PSF. Four trials (248 participants) did not primarily investigate the efficacy on fatigue but other symptoms after stroke. None of these interventions showed any benefit on reducing PSF, which included tirilazad mesylate, continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnoea, antidepressants and a self management programme for recovery from chronic diseases. There was insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue after stroke. Trials to date have been small and heterogeneous, and some have had a high risk of bias. Some of the interventions described were feasible in people with stroke, but their efficacy should be investigated in RCTs with a more robust study design and adequate sample sizes.","The evidence is current to May 2014. We found 12 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 703 people with stroke. Of these 12 trials, eight trials recruited only people with fatigue and were primarily intended to treat fatigue, no trial was primarily intended to prevent fatigue and the other four trials were not primarily intended to treat or prevent fatigue but reported fatigue as an outcome. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue in people with stroke. The general study quality was low. The available data were limited as each identified intervention was only investigated in a single trial. In addition, some trials were small and used poor study designs. Therefore, further trials of better quality are needed."
CD009396,"The review currently includes seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. Overall, sequence generation, allocation procedures and blinding were poorly reported. Trifluoperazine was not significantly different from low-potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low-potency drug 27%, 3 RCTs, n = 120, RR 0.96 CI 0.59 to 1.56, moderate quality evidence). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (trifluoperazine 20%, low-potency antipsychotics 16%, 3 RCTs, n = 239, RR 1.25, CI 0.72 to 2.17,low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in numbers with at least one adverse effect (trifluoperazine 60%, low-potency antipsychotics 38%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.60, CI 0.94 to 2.74, moderate quality evidence). However, at least one movement disorder was significantly more frequent in the trifluoperazine group (trifluoperazine 23%, low-potency antipsychotics 13%, 2 RCTs, n = 123, RR 2.08 CI 0.78 to 5.55, very low quality evidence) as well as incoordination (trifluoperazine 20%, low-potency antipsychotics 5%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 7.00, CI 1.60 to 30.66) and rigor (trifluoperazine 45%, low-potency antipsychotics 10%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 4.50, CI 1.58 to 12.84). No data were available for other outcomes of interest death, sedation and quality of life. The results did not show a difference in efficacy between trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics. Trifluoperazine produced more movement disorders. The number of randomised studies as well as their quality is low, the quality of evidence for outcomes of interest ranged from moderate to very low quality, so more, newer studies would be needed for conclusions about the relative effects of trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics.","Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low-potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high-potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side-effects. The classification into high-potency and low-potency medication means that low-potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side-effects that are common to most high-potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low-potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high-potency drugs with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high-potency antipsychotic) with low-potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low-potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine. The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people. It compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality. Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low-potency antipsychotics. However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things. They differ slightly in their side-effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low-potency antipsychotics was found. Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution. This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Benjamin Gray, Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness."
CD014821,"We included 19 RCTs with a total of 3489 randomised participants, aged eight to 95 years. Three studies examined only people with ulcerative colitis (UC), two studies examined only people with Crohn's disease (CD), and the remaining studies examined a mix of IBD patients. Studies considered a range of disease activity states. The length of the interventions ranged from six months to two years. The telehealth interventions were web-based and telephone-based. Web-based monitoring versus usual care
Twelve studies compared web-based disease monitoring to usual care. Three studies, all in adults, provided data on disease activity. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 254) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 174) in reducing disease activity in people with IBD (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.29). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. Five studies on adults provided dichotomous data that we could use for a meta-analysis on flare-ups. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 207/496) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 150/372) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with IBD (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided continuous data. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 465) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 444) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with CD (MD 0.00 events, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.06). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided dichotomous data on flare-ups in a paediatric population. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 28/84) may be equivalent to usual care (n = 29/86) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in children with IBD (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.51). The certainty of the evidence is low. Four studies, all in adults, provided data on quality of life. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 594) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 505) for quality of life in adults with IBD (SMD 0.08, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.20). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. Based on continuous data from one study in adults, we found that web-based disease monitoring probably leads to slightly higher medication adherence compared to usual care (MD 0.24 points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47). The results are of moderate certainty. Based on continuous data from one paediatric study, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (MD 0.00, 95% CI −0.63 to 0.63), although the evidence is very uncertain. When we meta-analysed dichotomous data from two studies on adults, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21), although the evidence is very uncertain. We were unable to draw any conclusions on the effects of web-based disease monitoring compared to usual care on healthcare access, participant engagement, attendance rate, interactions with healthcare professionals, and cost- or time-effectiveness. The certainty of the evidence is very low. The evidence in this review suggests that web-based disease monitoring is probably no different to standard care in adults when considering disease activity, occurrence of flare-ups or relapse, and quality of life. There may be no difference in these outcomes in children, but the evidence is limited. Web-based monitoring probably increases medication adherence slightly compared to usual care. We are uncertain about the effects of web-based monitoring versus usual care on our other secondary outcomes, and about the effects of the other telehealth interventions included in our review, because the evidence is limited. Further studies comparing web-based disease monitoring to standard care for the clinical outcomes reported in adults are unlikely to change our conclusions, unless they have longer follow-up or investigate under-reported outcomes or populations. Studies with a clearer definition of web-based monitoring would enhance applicability, enable practical dissemination and replication, and enable alignment with areas identified as important by stakeholders and people affected by IBD.","Providing care from a distance, also called telehealth, is becoming more common, especially since the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using technology to provide remote care could benefit people with inflammatory bowel disease. Telehealth can take place via telephone, instant messaging, video, text message, web-based services, or other means. We wanted to find which communication technologies are used for remote care in inflammatory bowel disease, how they are used, if they are accessible to everyone, and what are their benefits or drawbacks. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) comparing telehealth with any other treatment for people with inflammatory bowel disease. RCTs give us the highest standard of evidence. We applied no limitations for age or type of remote care in our search, but we excluded studies that did not focus on providing care, such as studies providing only patient information or education. We also excluded studies that provided remote blood or stool test monitoring with no other type of remote monitoring. We found 19 relevant RCTs, which enroled a combined total of 3489 people aged eight to 95 years. Remote care was delivered online (e.g. smartphone applications, websites) or by telephone. Twelve studies compared web-based care to usual care, three compared telephone-based care to usual care, three compared web-based care to ""sham"" care, one compared web-based care to self-care, and one compared psychological and telephone support to usual care. Web-based remote care is probably no different to usual care in adults for improving symptoms, avoiding relapses or flare-ups, and enhancing quality of life. We also found that people who receive web-based care are probably less likely to skip their medicines compared to those that receive usual care. We are moderately certain about these results based on the current evidence. The evidence on children is limited. With the currently available information, we cannot make any judgements on other parameters such as access to care, whether people with inflammatory bowel disease approve of these programmes and are encouraged to attend appointments, to what degree clinical professionals are involved in them, and costs or time. The evidence on other forms of remote care was also very limited. One limitation of the evidence was that the RCTs provided unclear descriptions of the remote care programmes, which means that any organisation wishing to copy and adopt these interventions would have difficulty doing so. The descriptions of usual care (the alternative treatment group in many studies) were also unclear. This means that standard care might be different from one study to another, which could make our findings less accurate. Few studies looked at forms of remote care other than web-based care. Another limitation is that the different studies measured different results (outcomes) of treatment. Finally, some studies used poor quality research methods. No further studies comparing web-based care to usual care in adults are necessary, unless they last for longer periods of time or give more details that would help clinicians adopt them anywhere in the world. This includes details on the type and number of staff needed, resources, equipment, costs, accessibility, and data security. More studies on children may be useful, as well as studies that examine differences based on sex and social or financial status. In any case, future studies should concentrate on measuring the results that matter most to people with inflammatory bowel disease and their care providers. This review is up-to-date as of January 2022."
CD003006,"The analysis included 24 trials reporting on 2226 participants of whom 239 developed TNS. Two studies are awaiting classification and one is ongoing. Included studies mostly had unclear to high risk of bias. The NMA included 24 studies and eight different local anaesthetics; the number of pair-wise comparisons was 32 and the number of different pair-wise comparisons was 11. This analysis showed that, compared to lidocaine, the risk ratio (RR) of TNS was lower for bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, and ropivacaine with RRs in the range of 0.10 to 0.23 while 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine did not differ in terms of RR of TNS development compared to lidocaine. Pair-wise meta-analysis showed that compared with lidocaine, most local anaesthetics were associated with a reduced risk of TNS development (except 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine) (bupivacaine: RR 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.28; 12 studies; moderate-quality evidence; 2-chloroprocaine: RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.51; 2 studies; low-quality evidence; levobupivacaine: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.69; 2 studies; low-quality evidence; mepivacaine: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.82; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence; prilocaine: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence; procaine: RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.52; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence; ropivacaine: RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.78; 2 studies; low-quality evidence). We were unable to perform any of our planned subgroup analyses due to the low number of TNS events. Results from both NMA and pair-wise meta-analysis indicate that the risk of developing TNS after spinal anaesthesia is lower when bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, and ropivacaine are used compared to lidocaine. The use of 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine had a similar risk to lidocaine in terms of TNS development after spinal anaesthesia. Patients should be informed of TNS as a possible adverse effect of local anaesthesia with lidocaine and the choice of anaesthetic agent should be based on the specific clinical context and parameters such as the expected duration of the procedure and the quality of anaesthesia. Due to the very low- to moderate-quality evidence (GRADE), future research efforts in this field are required to assess alternatives to lidocaine that would be able to provide high-quality anaesthesia without TNS development. The two studies awaiting classification and one ongoing study may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.","We included all randomized trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing the frequency of TNS and neurological complications after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine compared to other local anaesthetic agents. Randomized trials compare two or more treatments where the treatments are allocated to participants in a random manner that cannot be predicted by the study organizers. Quasi-randomized studies are similar but are not truly random, but carry a greater likelihood that the study organizer can predict which treatment the participants receive (e.g. based on date of birth or the order in which people were recruited). The evidence is current to 25 November 2018. We included 24 trials reporting on 2226 participants, 239 of whom developed TNS. There was no evidence TNS was associated with any specific neurological disease and symptoms disappeared spontaneously by the fifth postoperative day. The risk of developing TNS with lidocaine for spinal anaesthesia was increased compared to bupivacaine, prilocaine, or procaine; and similar compared to 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine. Specifically, when alternative local anaesthetics were compared directly to lidocaine, the risk of developing TNS was reduced by between 82% and 90% when bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, and ropivacaine were used rather than lidocaine. There were no clear differences in TNS between lidocaine and 2-chloroprocaine or mepivacaine. In the case of 2-chloroprocaine, TNS occurred in only one study and the results varied greatly for the small number of participants. Painful symptoms stopped by the fifth postoperative day in all participants. Among pregnant women undergoing surgery, only 3/310 women developed TNS; no conclusions could be drawn on whether symptoms were more likely with lidocaine. The authors also used the statistical method of network meta-analysis to compare the various local anaesthetics. This analysis similarly showed that the risk of TNS was lower for bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, and ropivacaine, while 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine did not differ in risk of TNS compared to lidocaine. Due to the very low- to moderate-quality of evidence among currently available studies, future research efforts in this field are needed to assess alternatives to lidocaine that can provide high-quality anaesthesia without TNS development. Lidocaine has been the drug of choice for inducing spinal anaesthesia in ambulatory surgery (or day surgery) because of its rapid onset of action, intense nerve blockade, and short duration of action. The present review shows that lidocaine is more likely to cause TNS than bupivacaine, prilocaine, and procaine. However, these drugs produce longer local anaesthetic effects and therefore are not desirable for ambulatory patients. Our results suggest that 2-chloroprocaine might be a viable alternative to lidocaine for day surgery of short duration and obstetric procedures since this local anaesthetic has a rapid onset of action, is quickly metabolized, and has low toxicity. However, this conclusion is based on only two studies and low-quality evidence."
CD005244,"Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall methodological quality was poor. Five studies used an injury outcome measure; one of these studies was randomised, the remaining four where CBA studies. The RCT targeting the alcohol server setting environment with an injury outcome compared the introduction of toughened glassware (experimental) to annealed glassware (control) on the number of bar staff injuries; a greater number of injuries were detected in the experimental group (relative risk 1.72, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.59). One CBA study investigated server training and estimated a reduction of 23% in single-vehicle, night-time crashes in the experimental area (controlled for crashes in the control area). Another CBA study examined the impact of a drink driving service, and reported a reduction in injury road crashes of 15% in the experimental area, with no change in the control; no difference was found for fatal crashes. In a CBA study investigating the impact of an intervention aiming to reduce crime in drinking premises, the study authors found a lower rate of all crime in the experimental premises (rate ratio 4.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 12, P = 0.01); no difference was found for injury (rate ratio 1.1 95% CI 0.1 to 10, P = 0.093). A CBA study investigating the impact of a policy intervention reported that pre-intervention the serious assault rate in the experimental area was 52% higher than the rate in the control area. After intervention, the serious assault rate in the experimental area was 37% lower than in the control area. The effects of such interventions on patron alcohol consumption is inconclusive. One randomised trial found a statistically significant reduction in observed severe aggression exhibited by patrons. There is some indication of improved server behaviour but it is difficult to predict what effect this might have on injury risk. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials and well conducted controlled before and after studies to determine the effect of interventions administered in the alcohol server setting on injuries. Compliance with interventions appears to be a problem; hence mandated interventions may be more likely to show an effect. Randomised controlled trials, with adequate allocation concealment and blinding are required to improve the evidence base. Further well-conducted, non-randomised trials are also needed when random allocation is not feasible.","The authors found 23 studies; only five of these measured the effect on injury, the remaining 18 measured the effect on behaviour (by the patrons and/or the servers of the alcohol within the premises). The studies investigated a range of interventions involving server training, health promotion initiatives, a drink driving service, a policy intervention and interventions that targeted the server setting environment. The authors concluded that there is insufficient high quality evidence that interventions in the alcohol server setting are effective in preventing injuries. The evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions on patron alcohol consumption was found to be inconclusive. There is conflicting evidence as to whether server behaviour is improved and it is difficult to predict what effect this might have on actual injury risk. Lack of compliance with interventions seems to be a particular problem; hence mandated interventions or those with associated incentives for compliance, may be more likely to show an effect. The methodology of future evaluations needs to be improved. The focus of research should be broadened to investigate the effectiveness of interventions other than server training, where previous research dominates. When the collection of injury outcome data is not feasible, research is needed to identify the most useful proxy indicators."
CD003270,"Two small trials recruiting 23 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review. Participants may have been suffering from comorbid lung disease. No data on oral steroid consumption were reported. No significant differences were observed in the studies for FEV1, FVC, PaO2 and symptoms. One study reported a statistically significant difference in SGaw, but the clinical importance of this is uncertain. Due to concerns over the small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings in terms of inadequate washout in one study, and methods used in outcome assessment for both studies, the findings of the studies are not generalisable to the issue of steroid tapering. An update search conducted in August 2010 did not identify any new studies for consideration in the review. Currently there is a clear lack of evidence to support the use of azathioprine in the treatment of chronic asthma as a steroid sparing-agent. Large, long-term studies with pre-defined steroid reducing protocols are required before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.",The review found two small studies which did not provide adequate evidence as to whether azathioprine could be offered to reduce oral steroid treatment. There is a need for well-designed trials addressing this question before recommendations can be made.
CD010696,"We included 17 studies, with a total of 1025 participants; 12 studies were published (567 patients) and five were unpublished (458 patients). Sixteen studies including 953 people compared betahistine with placebo. All studies with analysable data lasted three months or less. The majority were at high risk of bias, but in some the risk of bias was unclear. One study, at high risk of bias, included 72 people with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and compared betahistine with placebo; all patients also had particle repositioning manoeuvres. The studies varied considerably in terms of types of participants, their diagnoses, the dose of betahistine and the length of time it was taken for, the study methods and the way any improvement in vertigo symptoms was measured. Using the GRADE system, we judged the quality of evidence overall to be low for two outcomes (proportion of patients with improvement and proportion with adverse events). Pooled data showed that the proportion of patients reporting an overall reduction in their vertigo symptoms was higher in the group treated with betahistine than the placebo group: risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.60; 606 participants; 11 studies). This result should be interpreted with caution as the test for statistical heterogeneity as measured by the I2 value was high. Adverse effects (mostly gastrointestinal symptoms and headache) were common but medically serious events in the study were rare and isolated: there was no difference in the frequency of adverse effects between the betahistine and placebo groups, where the rates were 16% and 15% respectively (weighted values, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.40; 819 participants; 12 studies). Sixteen per cent of patients from both the betahistine and the placebo groups withdrew (dropped out) from the studies (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.42; 481 participants; eight studies). Three studies looked at objective vestibular function tests as an outcome; the numbers of participants were small, techniques of measurement very diverse and reporting details sparse, so analysis of this outcome was inconclusive. We looked for information on generic quality of life and falls, but none of the studies reported on these outcomes. Low quality evidence suggests that in patients suffering from vertigo from different causes there may be a positive effect of betahistine in terms of reduction in vertigo symptoms. Betahistine is generally well tolerated with a low risk of adverse events. Future research into the management of vertigo symptoms needs to use more rigorous methodology and include outcomes that matter to patients and their families.","We included 17 studies, with a total of 1025 participants.

However, there was significant variability in the results of the studies so this result should be treated with caution. The proportion of patients reporting side effects of the medication was similar in both groups: 16% in the betahistine groups and 15% in the placebo groups. Overall, 16% of patients of both groups withdrew from the studies. There was insufficient information about the effect of betahistine on objective tests of inner ear balance organ function. There was no information on the effect of betahistine on overall quality of life or falls. We judged the quality of evidence from the included studies to be low, meaning our estimates of the effects of betahistine could turn out to be inaccurate. The evidence is up to date to September 2015. Low quality evidence suggests that patients suffering from vertigo from different causes may have some benefit from betahistine in terms of reduction in vertigo symptoms. Betahistine is generally well tolerated. Future research into the management of vertigo symptoms needs to use more rigorous methodology and include outcomes that matter to patients and their families."
CD008887,"We screened 1290 records and found only three trials involving 154 female participants, all of whom were aged above 65 years and had had hip fracture surgery. All studies had methodological shortcomings that placed them at high or unclear risk of bias. Because of this high risk of bias, imprecise results and likelihood of publication bias, we judged the quality of the evidence for all primary outcomes to be very low. These trials tested two comparisons. One trial had three groups and contributed data to both comparisons. None of the trials reported on patient acceptability of the intervention. Two very different trials compared anabolic steroid versus control (no anabolic steroid or placebo). One trial compared anabolic steroid injections (given weekly until discharge from hospital or four weeks, whichever came first) versus placebo injections in 29 ""frail elderly females"". This found very low quality evidence of little difference between the two groups in the numbers discharged to a higher level of care or dead (one person in the control group died) (8/15 versus 10/14; risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.33; P = 0.32), time to independent mobilisation or individual adverse events. The second trial compared anabolic steroid injections (every three weeks for six months) and daily protein supplementation versus daily protein supplementation alone in 40 ""lean elderly women"" who were followed up for one year after surgery. This trial provided very low quality evidence that anabolic steroid may result in less dependency, assessed in terms of being either dependent in at least two functions or dead (one person in the control group died) at six and 12 months, but the result was also compatible with no difference or an increase in dependency (dependent in at least two levels of function or dead at 12 months: 1/17 versus 5/19; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.73; P = 0.15). The trial found no evidence of between-group differences in individual adverse events. Two trials compared anabolic steroids combined with another nutritional intervention ('steroid plus') versus control (no 'steroid plus'). One trial compared anabolic steroid injections every three weeks for 12 months in combination with daily supplement of vitamin D and calcium versus calcium only in 63 women who were living independently at home. The other trial compared anabolic steroid injections every three weeks for six months and daily protein supplementation versus control in 40 ""lean elderly women"". Both trials found some evidence of better function in the steroid plus group. One trial reported greater independence, higher Harris hip scores and gait speeds in the steroid plus group at 12 months. The second trial found fewer participants in the anabolic steroid group were either dependent in at least two functions, including bathing, or dead at six and 12 months (one person in the control group died) (1/17 versus 7/18; RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.10; P = 0.06). Pooled mortality data (2/51 versus 3/51) from the two trials showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups at one year. Similarly, there was no evidence of between-group differences in individual adverse events. Three participants in the steroid group of one trial reported side effects of hoarseness and increased facial hair. The other trial reported better quality of life in the steroid plus group. The available evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects, primarily in terms of functional outcome and adverse events, of anabolic steroids, either separately or in combination with nutritional supplements, after surgical treatment of hip fracture in older people. Given that the available data points to the potential for more promising outcomes with a combined anabolic steroid and nutritional supplement intervention, we suggest that future research should focus on evaluating this combination.","There were only three studies available and all three were small and at high risk of bias. We therefore judged the quality of the evidence to be very low, which means that we are uncertain how reliable the evidence is. Two very different studies compared anabolic steroid versus control (no anabolic steroid or placebo). One study conducted in the hospital ward compared weekly anabolic steroid injections versus placebo injections in 29 ""frail elderly females"". This study found no evidence that anabolic steroid resulted in better function, as measured by numbers discharged to a higher level of care or dead, or the time to mobilisation. The second study compared steroid injections given every three weeks for six months plus daily protein supplementation versus daily protein supplementation alone in 40 ""lean elderly women"". This study provided some evidence that anabolic steroids may result in better function, but they may also make no difference or result in worse function. Neither study found a difference in the incidence of individual adverse events in the two groups. Two studies compared anabolic steroids combined with another nutritional intervention ('steroid plus') versus control (no 'steroid plus'). One study compared anabolic steroid injections every three weeks for 12 months in combination with daily supplement of vitamin D and calcium versus calcium only in 63 women who were living independently at home. The other study compared anabolic steroid injections every three weeks for six months and daily protein supplementation versus control in 40 ""lean elderly women"".

Three participants in the steroid group of one study reported side effects of hoarseness and increased facial hair. The other study reported better quality of life in the steroid plus group. None of the studies reported on patient acceptability of the intervention. The quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the direction and size of effect. Thus we are unable to say if anabolic steroids, either separately or in combination with nutritional supplements, improve recovery after hip fracture surgery in older people. Given that the results available point to the potential for more promising outcomes with a combined anabolic steroid and nutritional supplement intervention, we suggest that future research should focus on evaluating this combination."
CD003212,"We included 19 trials (2738 infants). Compared to NCPAP, NIPPV likely reduces the risk of respiratory failure postextubation (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.84; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 8 to 17; 19 trials, 2738 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) and endotracheal reintubation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 25; 17 trials, 2608 infants, moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce pulmonary air leaks (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87; NNTB 50, 95% CI 33 to infinite; 13 trials, 2404 infants; low-certainty evidence). NIPPV likely results in little to no difference in gastrointestinal perforation (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.38; 8 trials, 1478 infants, low-certainty evidence), NEC (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.15; 10 trials, 2069 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), chronic lung disease defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 9 trials, 2001 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) and mortality prior to discharge (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; 11 trials, 2258 infants; low-certainty evidence). When considering subgroup analysis, ventilator-generated NIPPV likely reduces respiratory failure postextubation (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.62; 1057 infants; I2 = 47%; moderate-certainty evidence), while bilevel devices (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17; 716 infants) or a mix of both ventilator-generated and bilevel devices likely results in little to no difference (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.02; 965 infants). NIPPV likely reduces the incidence of extubation failure and the need for reintubation within 48 hours to one-week postextubation more effectively than NCPAP in very preterm infants (GA 28 weeks and above). There is a paucity of data for infants less than 28 weeks' gestation. Pulmonary air leaks were also potentially reduced in the NIPPV group. However, it has no effect on other clinically relevant outcomes such as gastrointestinal perforation, NEC, chronic lung disease or mortality. Ventilator-generated NIPPV appears superior to bilevel devices in reducing the incidence of respiratory failure postextubation failure and need for reintubation. Synchronisation used to deliver NIPPV may be important; however, data are insufficient to support strong conclusions. Future trials should enrol a sufficient number of infants, particularly those less than 28 weeks' GA, to detect differences in death or chronic lung disease and should compare different categories of devices, establish the impact of synchronisation of NIPPV on safety and efficacy of the technique as well as the best combination of settings for NIPPV (rate, peak pressure and positive end-expiratory). Trials should strive to match the mean airway pressure between the intervention groups to allow a better comparison. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist needs further assessment with properly powered randomised trials.","We wanted to find out if NIPPV has short-term and long-term benefits without causing harm to premature infants when coming off a ventilator and how it compares with NCPAP. We searched scientific databases for studies comparing NCPAP versus NIPPV in preterm infants (born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) who no longer needed an endotracheal tube. We looked at breathing problems, the need for the endotracheal tube to be reinserted and side effects. We found 19 trials comparing NCPAP versus NIPPV. When compiling the results of the trials, we found that NIPPV likely reduces the need for reinsertion of the endotracheal tube for very preterm infants (time since first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to 28 weeks and above). NIPPV may also lead to a reduced number of air leaks from the air spaces of the lungs. There was little to no difference in other outcomes measured in this review. In clinical trials, clinicians and investigators were aware of the treatment received by each infant (NIPPV or NCPAP). Therefore, we have moderate confidence in the evidence for breathing problems and need for reinsertion of the endotracheal tube. Evidence is current to January 2023."
CD012898,"We included 12 studies (n = 1837), of which, three compared PCT to a wait-list/minimal attention (WL/MA) group and 11 compared PCT to TF-CBT. PCT was more effective than WL/MA in reducing PTSD symptom severity (SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.59; participants = 290; studies = 3; I² = 0%). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. The results of the non-inferiority analysis comparing PCT to TF-CBT did not support PCT non-inferiority, with the 95% confidence interval surpassing the clinically meaningful cut-off (MD 6.83, 95% CI 1.90 to 11.76; 6 studies, n = 607; I² = 42%).

These results were consistent with the primary MD outcomes, with meaningful effect size differences between PCT and TF-CBT at post-treatment (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.56; participants = 1129; studies = 9), but smaller effect size differences at six months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29; participants = 1339; studies = 9) and 12 months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31; participants = 728; studies = 5). PCT had approximately 14% lower treatment dropout rates compared to TF-CBT (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10; participants = 1542; studies = 10). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. There was no evidence of meaningful differences on self-reported PTSD (MD 4.50, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.90; participants = 983; studies = 7) or depression symptoms (MD 1.78, 95% CI -0.23 to 3.78; participants = 705; studies = 5) post-treatment. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that PCT is more effective in reducing PTSD severity compared to control conditions. Low quality of evidence did not support PCT as a non-inferior treatment compared to TF-CBT on clinician-rated post-treatment PTSD severity. The treatment effect differences between PCT and TF-CBT may attenuate over time. PCT participants drop out of treatment at lower rates relative to TF-CBT participants. Of note, all of the included studies were primarily designed to test the effectiveness of TF-CBT which may bias results away from PCT non-inferiority.The current systematic review provides the most rigorous evaluation to date to determine whether PCT is comparably as effective as TF-CBT. Findings are generally consistent with current clinical practice guidelines that suggest that PCT may be offered as a treatment for PTSD when TF-CBT is not available.","This review included 12 studies that comprised a total of 1837 participants. Eleven studies that included 1826 participants contributed to the quantitative syntheses. Participants were all adults, but ranged in demographics and trauma types. All studies recruited participants in the United States and there was a predominance of studies conducted on military veterans. PCT does not appear to be as effective as trauma focused treatments in reducing PTSD severity at post-treatment. However, PCT is associated with reduced treatment dropout rates compared to TF-CBT. Several of the TF-CBT trials included in this review were well designed and executed. However, we assessed the overall quality of evidence for our primary outcome (post-treatment PTSD severity) as low based on inconsistent outcomes and some imprecision in the results. We rated the quality of the evidence on differential treatment dropout as moderate."
CD012851,"We included four studies, involving 199 randomised participants (164 analysed), 108 girls and 91 boys, 82 of whom were diagnosed with unilateral PDC and 117 with bilateral PDC. The participants were aged between 8 and 13 years at recruitment. The certainty of the evidence was very low and future research may change our conclusions. One study (randomised 67 participants, 89 teeth) found that extracting the primary canine may increase the proportion of PDCs that successfully erupt into the mouth at 12 months compared with no extraction (RR 2.87, 95% CI 0.90 to 9.23; 45 participants, 45 PDCs analysed; very low-certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no difference; therefore the evidence was uncertain. There was no evidence that extraction of the primary canine reduced the number of young people with a PDC referred for surgery at 12 months (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.28). Three studies (randomised 132 participants, 227 teeth) found no difference in the proportion of successfully erupted PDCs at 18 months with a double primary tooth extraction compared with extraction of a single primary canine (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.31; 119 participants analysed, 203 PDCs; mITT; very low-certainty evidence). Two of these studies found no difference in the proportions referred for surgical exposure between the single and the double primary extraction groups data at 48 months (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.45). There are some descriptive data suggesting that the more severe the displacement of the PDC towards the midline, the lower the proportion of successfully erupted PDCs with or without intervention. The evidence that extraction of the primary canine in a young person aged between 9 and 14 years diagnosed with a PDC may increase the proportion of erupted PDCs, without surgical intervention, is very uncertain. There is no evidence that double extraction of primary teeth increases the proportion of erupted PDC compared with a single primary tooth extraction at 18 months or the proportion referred for surgery by 48 months. Because we have only low to very low certainty in these findings, future research is necessary to help us know for sure the best way to deal with upper permanent teeth that are not erupting as expected.","We wanted to find out if any of these treatment alternatives were successful for children aged 9 to 14 years, in terms of encouraging PDCs to erupt without using surgery. We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of different ways to deal with palatally displaced canines up to 3 February 2021. Where studies measured the same thing in the same or similar ways, we combined the results to give us a clearer idea about the effects of the treatment. We assessed whether the individual studies were at risk of being biased and we judged the overall reliability of the evidence we found. We found four studies involving 199 children (195 analysed). There is very weak evidence that extraction of the primary canine in children aged between 9 and 14 years may increase the probability that the PDC will successfully erupt into the mouth without the need for surgery by 12 months. There is no evidence it reduces the number of children needing surgery to correct their PDC. There is no evidence that double extraction of primary teeth increases the proportion of erupted PDCs compared with a single primary tooth extraction by 18 months after treatment or that it reduces the number of children needing surgery to correct the PDC by 48 months. There is some limited evidence suggesting that the severity of the displacement of the PDC towards the midline may be important in deciding whether or not to intervene. If it is very far from the midline, it may be less likely to be successful. The review authors found the reliability of the evidence to be very low so future research is necessary to help us know for sure the best way to deal with upper permanent canines that are not erupting as expected."
CD006850,"We included seven studies (662 participants). Five were planned as RCTs and two as prospective controlled trials. One RCT failed completely, another was continued as an observational study, reporting also the results of the participants that had been randomized. There was very low quality evidence from one small RCT (111 participants) that quality of life (QoL) during treatment did not differ significantly between rigid bracing and observation (mean difference (MD) -2.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.69 to 3.49). There was very low quality evidence from a subgroup of 77 adolescents from one prospective cohort study showing that QoL, back pain, psychological, and cosmetic issues did not differ significantly between rigid bracing and observation in the long term (16 years). Results of the secondary outcomes showed that there was low quality evidence that rigid bracing compared with observation significantly increased the success rate in 20° to 40° curves at two years' follow-up (one RCT, 116 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.79, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.50). There was low quality evidence that elastic bracing increased the success rate in 15° to 30° curves at three years' follow-up (one RCT, 47 participants; RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.20). There is very low quality evidence from two prospective cohort studies with a control group that rigid bracing increases the success rate (curves not evolving to 50° or above) at two years' follow-up (one study, 242 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.89) and at three years' follow-up (one study, 240 participants; RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.16). There was very low quality evidence from a prospective cohort study (57 participants) that very rigid bracing increased the success rate (no progression of 5° or more, fusion, or waiting list for fusion) in adolescents with high degree curves (above 45°) (one study, 57 adolescents; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.07 in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). There was low quality evidence from one RCT that a rigid brace was more successful than an elastic brace at curbing curve progression when measured in Cobb degrees in low degree curves (20° to 30°), with no significant differences between the two groups in the subjective perception of daily difficulties associated with wearing the brace (43 girls; risk of success at four years' follow-up: RR 1.40, 1.03 to 1.89). Finally, there was very low quality evidence from one RCT (12 participants) that a rigid brace with a pad pressure control system is no better than a standard brace in reducing the risk of progression. Only one prospective cohort study (236 participants) assessed adverse events: neither the percentage of adolescents with any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.67) nor the percentage of adolescents reporting back pain, the most common adverse event, were different between the groups (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.10). Due to the important clinical differences among the studies, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. Two studies showed that bracing did not change QoL during treatment (low quality), and QoL, back pain, and psychological and cosmetic issues in the long term (16 years) (very low quality). All included papers consistently showed that bracing prevented curve progression (secondary outcome). However, due to the strength of evidence (from low to very low quality), further research is very likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. The high rate of failure of RCTs demonstrates the huge difficulties in performing RCTs in a field where parents reject randomization of their children. This challenge may prevent us from seeing increases in the quality of the evidence over time. Other designs need to be implemented and included in future reviews, including 'expertise-based' trials, prospective controlled cohort studies, prospective studies conducted according to pre-defined criteria such as the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) and the international Society on Scoliosis Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) criteria. Future studies should increase their focus on participant outcomes, adverse effects, methods to increase compliance, and usefulness of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises added to bracing.","This review included seven studies, with a total of 662 adolescents of both genders. AIS from 15° to more than 45° curves were considered. Elastic, rigid (polyethylene), and very rigid (polycarbonate) braces were studied. The evidence is current to October 2013. Funding sources were not reported or external governmental or scientific agencies. We did not find any results on pulmonary disorders and disability. Quality of life was not affected during brace treatment (very low quality evidence); quality of life, back pain, and psychological and cosmetic issues did not change in the long term (very low quality evidence). Rigid bracing seems effective in 20° to 40° curves (low quality evidence), elastic bracing in 15° to 30° curves (low quality evidence), and very rigid bracing in high degree curves above 45° (very low quality evidence); rigid was more successful than an elastic bracing (low quality evidence), and a pad pressure control system did not increase results (very low quality evidence). No specific harms were reported. Primary outcomes such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological and cosmetic issues, and quality of life should be better evaluated in the future. Side effects, as well as the usefulness of exercises and other adjunctive treatments to bracing should be studied too. The evidence was moderate to very low quality. Reason for downgrading were evidence coming from few randomized trials with few participants and many lost at follow-up or from observational prospective controlled studies. An issue in the field of AIS is the high rate of failure of RCTs, since parents want to choose with physicians the preferred treatment for their children. Thus, it is challenging to obtain high quality evidence in this field."
CD015125,"Inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with/without placebo)
People with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19
We found no studies that included people with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. People with a confirmed diagnosis of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19
We included three RCTs allocating 3607 participants, of whom 2490 had confirmed mild COVID-19. We analysed a subset of the total number of participants recruited to the studies (2171, 52% female) as some trials had a platform design where not all participants were allocated to treatment groups simultaneously. The included studies were community-based, recruiting people who were able to use inhaler devices to deliver steroids and relied on remote assessment and self-reporting of outcomes. Most people were older than 50 years and had co-morbidities such as hypertension, lung disease, or diabetes. The studies were conducted in high-income countries prior to wide-scale vaccination programmes. A total of 1057 participants were analysed in the inhaled corticosteroid arm (budesonide: 860 participants; ciclesonide: 197 participants), and 1075 participants in the control arm. No studies included people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. With respect to the following outcomes, inhaled corticosteroids compared to standard care:
– may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (at up to day 30) (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.67; 2132 participants; low-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this means that for every nine deaths per 1000 people not receiving inhaled corticosteroids, there were six deaths per 1000 people who did receive the intervention (95% CI 2 to 16 per 1000 people);
– probably reduces admission to hospital or death (at up to 30 days) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.99; 2025 participants; moderate-certainty evidence);
– probably increases resolution of all initial symptoms at day 14 (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.30; 1986 participants; moderate-certainty evidence);
– may reduce the duration to symptom resolution (at up to day 30) (by −4.00 days, 95% CI −6.22 to −1.78 less than control group rate of 12 days; 139 participants; low-certainty evidence);
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (during study period) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.76; 1586 participants; very low-certainty evidence);
– may result in little to no difference in adverse events (at up to day 30) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.31; 400 participants; low-certainty evidence);
– may result in little to no difference in infections (during study period) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.58; 400 participants; low-certainty evidence). As studies did not report outcomes for subgroups (e.g. age, ethnicity, sex), we did not perform subgroup analyses. In people with confirmed COVID-19 and mild symptoms who are able to use inhaler devices, we found moderate-certainty evidence that inhaled corticosteroids probably reduce the combined endpoint of admission to hospital or death and increase the resolution of all initial symptoms at day 14. Low-certainty evidence suggests that corticosteroids make little to no difference in all-cause mortality up to day 30 and may decrease the duration to symptom resolution. We do not know whether inhaled corticosteroids increase or decrease serious adverse events due to heterogeneity in the way they were reported across the studies. There is low-certainty evidence that inhaled corticosteroids may decrease infections. The evidence we identified came from studies in high-income settings using budesonide and ciclesonide prior to vaccination roll-outs. We identified a lack of evidence concerning quality of life assessments, serious adverse events, and people with asymptomatic infection or with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The 10 ongoing and four completed, unpublished RCTs that we identified in trial registries address similar settings and research questions as in the current body of evidence. We expect to incorporate the findings of these studies in future versions of this review. We monitor newly published results of RCTs on inhaled corticosteroids on a weekly basis and will update the review when the evidence or our certainty in the evidence changes.","People need more and better treatment options for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19) or mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19. We wanted to know if inhaled corticosteroids are an effective and helpful treatment option for COVID-19 in any setting (for example, home or hospital) and whether they cause unwanted effects. We were interested in:
– death from any cause up to day 30, day 60, or longer if reported;
– admission to hospital or death within 30 days;
– whether symptoms resolved and how fast;
– quality of life;
– unwanted effects. We looked for studies where the investigators compared inhaled corticosteroids and usual care to usual care only, sometimes in addition to a dummy medicine that did not contain any active ingredients (placebo) but was given in the same way. To make the comparison least skewed and more fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the inhaled corticosteroids or the other treatment. The studies could include people of any age, sex, or ethnicity. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. Three studies compared inhaled corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo in people with a confirmed diagnosis of mild COVID-19. These studies analysed 2171 participants mostly older than 50 years and with other medical problems, 52% of them were female, of whom 1057 received inhaled corticosteroids in our analyses. We found no studies that included people with asymptomatic infection or confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. We also found 10 ongoing studies, and four completed studies without published results. All studies compared inhaled corticosteroids with usual care or placebo. The studies included only people with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease. No studies looked at hospitalised people or people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhaled corticosteroids
– may make little to no difference in death from any cause up to day 30;
– probably reduce the risk of admission to hospital or occurrence of death up to day 30;
– probably increase resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at day 14 and may reduce time to symptom resolution. We are very uncertain about a possible difference in serious unwanted effects. Moreover, inhaled corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in the number of any unwanted effects or additional infections. The studies were conducted in populations from wealthy countries, prior to the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. We have moderate confidence in the evidence for the outcomes of symptom resolution at day 14 and hospital admission. We have low confidence in the evidence for the effects on deaths from any cause for people with mild COVID-19 and time to symptom resolution. The confidence in the unwanted or serious unwanted effects and infections is low or very low, because of the differences in the way investigators recorded and reported results. There was no evidence for people with asymptomatic infection or moderate-to-severe COVID-19 who were hospitalised. Our evidence is up-to-date to 7 October 2021."
CD007557,"In this update, we included three trials involving 1398 postoperative participants. Participants were submitted to general surgical procedures, minor and major, and the minimum mean age was 49 years. Pooled analysis showed a significant reduction in the risk of HIT with LMWH compared with UFH (risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.73); low-quality evidence. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 59. The risk of HIT was consistently reduced comparing participants undergoing major surgical procedures exposed to LMWH or UFH (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.75); low-quality evidence. The occurrence of HIT complicated by venous thromboembolism was significantly lower in participants receiving LMWH compared with UFH (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.84); low-quality evidence. The NNTB was 75. Arterial thrombosis occurred in only one participant who received UFH. There were no amputations or deaths documented. Although limited evidence is available, it appears that HIT induced by both types of heparins is common in people undergoing major surgical procedures (incidence greater than 1% and less than 10%). This updated review demonstrated low-quality evidence of a lower incidence of HIT, and HIT complicated by venous thromboembolism, in postoperative patients undergoing thromboprophylaxis with LMWH compared with UFH. Similarily, the risk of HIT in people undergoing major surgical procedures was lower when treated with LMWH compared to UFH (low-quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to concerns about the risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the study results. These findings may support current clinical use of LMWH over UFH as front-line heparin therapy. However, our conclusions are limited and there was an unexpected paucity of RCTs including HIT as an outcome. To address the scarcity of clinically-relevant information on HIT, HIT must be included as a core harmful outcome in future RCTs of heparin.","The evidence gathered in this review was considered of low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because we had concerns about the risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the results. It was possible that patient prognosis or clinicians' preferences influenced the allocation of participants to receive one or another medication. This process should be implemented by chance to allow a fair comparison between the therapies. We were not confident that staff implementing the trials were not aware of which treatment participants were receiving, and it was possible that the incomplete reporting of data could have affected the estimates. The detection of HIT throughout the trials was also problematic, and we were not confident that it was performed adequately. The results may be correct, but they may be changed by future research."
CD005497,"Eleven randomized controlled trials met our criteria for inclusion, representing 7695 patients in the United States, China, India and Sweden. Advance provision did not decrease pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25 in studies for which we included twelve-month follow-up data; OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.29 in a study with seven-month follow-up data; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.20 in studies for which we included six-month follow-up data; OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74 in a study with three-month follow-up data), despite reported increased use (single use: OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.40; multiple use: OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.77 to 9.63) and faster use (weighted mean difference (WMD) -12.98 hours, 95% CI -16.66 to -9.31 hours). Advance provision did not lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.37), increased frequency of unprotected intercourse, or changes in contraceptive methods. Women who received emergency contraception in advance were equally likely to use condoms as other women. Advance provision of emergency contraception did not reduce pregnancy rates when compared to conventional provision. Results from primary analyses suggest that advance provision does not negatively impact sexual and reproductive health behaviors and outcomes. Women should have easy access to emergency contraception, because it can decrease the chance of pregnancy. However, the interventions tested thus far have not reduced overall pregnancy rates in the populations studied.","We searched for studies comparing women who got emergency contraception in advance to women who got it in standard ways. We examined whether these groups had different rates of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. We also studied how often and how quickly both groups used emergency contraception. Finally, we looked at whether advance provision of emergency contraception changed sexual behavior. Studies showed that the chance of pregnancy was similar regardless of whether or not women have emergency contraception on hand before unprotected sex. Women who had emergency contraception in advance were more likely to report use of the medication, and to use it sooner after sex. Having emergency contraception on hand did not change use of other kinds of contraception or change sexual behavior."
CD010586,"We included 12 studies (430 participants) in the review: seven RCTs and five CCTs where it was not clear whether participants were randomly allocated to groups. We did not include any unpublished studies. Participants included children and adults of both sexes. Only one study included pregnant women. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. The quality of the 11 studies in the initial meta-analysis was moderate, although we classified no study as having a low risk of bias on all criteria. We included 11 studies in the initial meta-analysis of gamma-globulin (concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulins) versus control (saline or no treatment) for rubella cases. The result favoured the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.83) but was heterogenous (Chi² test = 36.59, df = 10 (P value < 0.0001); I² statistic = 73%). Heterogeneity was explained by subgrouping studies according to the estimated volume of gamma-globulin administered per pound of bodyweight and then removing those studies where the intervention was administered more than five days after participant exposure to rubella (post hoc analysis). The test of subgroup differences demonstrated heterogeneity between subgroups according to our protocol definition (P value < 0.1; I² statistic > 60%) and there appeared to be greater effectiveness of the intervention when a greater volume of gamma-globulin was administered ('0.027 to 0.037 ml/lb' RR 1.60 (95% CI 0.57 to 4.52); '0.1 to 0.15 ml/lb' RR 0.53 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.99); '0.2 to 0.5 ml/lb' RR 0.20 (95% CI 0.04 to 1.00)). None of the studies reported the outcome 'congenital rubella infection'. One included study reported on congenital rubella syndrome, with no cases among participants who were fewer than nine weeks pregnant at enrolment and who were randomised to one of two gamma-globulin groups ('high' or 'low' rubella titre). However, the study did not report how congenital rubella syndrome was measured and did not report the length of follow-up according to intervention group. This study did not include a non-treatment group. No included study measured adverse events. Compared to no treatment, polyclonal immunoglobulins seem to be of benefit for preventing rubella. The available evidence suggests that this intervention may be of benefit up to five days after exposure, and that effectiveness is dependent on dose. Considering the attack rate for rubella cases in the control group of the highest volume gamma-globulin subgroup (333 per 1000), the absolute risk reduction (calculated from the RR) for this volume of gamma-globulin was 266 (95% CI 0 to 320) and the number needed to treat to benefit is four (95% CI 3 to incalculable). The included studies did not measure rubella-specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin products used in a standard way and thus estimation of the dose of rubella-specific antibodies in international units administered was not possible. As the concentration of rubella-specific antibodies in today's polyclonal immunoglobulin products may vary from those products used in the studies in the review, the volume required per pound of bodyweight to produce similar results may also vary. There is insufficient evidence to make direct conclusions about the effectiveness of polyclonal immunoglobulins for preventing congenital rubella syndrome. This is an area requiring further research.","The evidence is current to August 2014. We included 12 studies (430 participants). People of all ages were included in the studies, which were conducted in high-income countries. Eleven studies (389 participants) compared injecting antibodies into the muscle or vein of participants to injecting salt water or giving no treatment. The study participants did not have their own antibodies. They had been in contact with rubella between one and 28 days prior to receiving the antibodies. The antibodies seemed to be effective at preventing participants from catching rubella, with those receiving antibodies 39% less likely to develop rubella than those not given antibodies. In an analysis of the seven studies (89 participants) where participants had been in contact with rubella only up to five days earlier, people given the highest doses used in the studies were 80% less likely to develop rubella than those not given antibodies. The studies assessing the prevention of rubella were of moderate quality because of some methodological issues and the fairly small number of participants. It is important to consider that the amount of rubella antibodies in today's blood donations may differ from those used in the studies. Therefore, doses given today may need to vary from those of the studies in order to obtain the same effect. Only one study included pregnant women. All of the women were given one of two different doses of antibodies. They did not measure whether the babies born to the women were infected with rubella, but did consider whether birth defects that may be related to rubella were present. Key details about the study methods were missing and unobtainable, so the quality of this study was unclear. None of the babies born to these women were identified as having birth defects related to rubella. However, we cannot draw direct conclusions from this single study about the effectiveness of injecting antibodies after contact with rubella for preventing rubella-related birth defects in pregnant women. This is an area that needs further research. The included studies did not report adverse events. Future studies should report this outcome."
CD011425,"We included in our review three studies (Moy 2015; Tabak 2013; Voncken-Brewster 2015) with a total of 1580 randomised participants. From Voncken-Brewster 2015, we included the subgroup of individuals with a diagnosis of COPD (284 participants) and excluded those at risk of COPD who had not received a diagnosis (1023 participants). As a result, the total population available for analysis included 557 participants; 319 received smart technology to support self-management and 238 received face-to-face verbal/written or digital information and education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64 years. We included more men than women because the sample from one of the studies consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. These studies measured five of our nine defined outcomes. None of these studies included outcomes such as self-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, functional capacity, lung function, or anxiety and depression. All three studies included our primary outcome - health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study reported our other primary outcomes - hospital admissions and acute exacerbations. Two studies included our secondary outcome of physical activity as measured by daily step counts. One study addressed smoking by providing a narrative analysis. Only one study reported adverse events and noted significant differences between groups, with 43 events noted in the intervention group and eight events in the control group (P = 0.001). For studies that measured outcomes at week four, month four, and month six, the effect of smart technology on self-management and subsequent HRQoL in terms of symptoms and health status was significantly better than when participants received face-to-face/digital and/or written support for self-management of COPD (SMD -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.03; P = 0.02). The single study that reported HRQoL at 12 months described no significant between-group differences (MD 1.1, 95% CI -2.2 to 4.5; P = 0.50). Also, hospitalisations (logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.19) and exacerbations (logistic regression OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.8; P = 0.33) did not differ between groups in the single study that reported these outcomes at 12 months. The activity level of people with COPD at week four, month four, and month six was significantly higher when smart technology was used than when face-to-face/digital and/or written support was provided (MD 864.06 daily steps between groups, 95% CI 369.66 to 1358.46; P = 0.0006). The only study that measured activity levels at 12 months reported no significant differences between groups (mean -108, 95% CI -720 to 505; P = 0.73). Participant engagement in this study was not sustained between four and 12 months. The only study that included smoking cessation found no significant treatment effect (OR 1.06, 95%CI 0.43 to 2.66; P = 0.895). Meta-analyses showed no significant heterogeneity between studies (Chi² = 0.39, P = 0.82; I² = 0% and Chi² = 0.01, P = 0.91; I² = 0%, respectively). Although our review suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-managment in people with COPD and delivered via smart technology significantly improved HRQoL and levels of activity up to six months compared with interventions given through face-to-face/digital and/or written support, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This improvement may not be sustained over a long duration. The only included study that measured outcomes up to 12 months highlighted the need to ensure sustained engagement with the technology over time. Limited evidence suggests that using computer and mobile technology for self-management for people with COPD is not harmful and may be more beneficial for some people than for others, for example, those with an interest in using technology may derive greater benefit. The evidence, provided by three studies at high risk of bias, is of poor quality and is insufficient for advising healthcare professionals, service providers, and members of the public with COPD about the health benefits of using smart technology as an effective means of supporting, encouraging, and sustaining self-management. Further research that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD is needed. Researchers should provide clear information on how self-management is assessed and should include longitudinal measures that allow comment on behavioural change.","We included in our review 557 participants from three studies; 319 received smart technology to support self-management, and 238 received face-to-face verbal/written or digital information and education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64 years. Our review included more men than women because the sample from one study consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. Participants used the technology for just four weeks in one study to six months in the second and four months in the third, which also reported data at 12 months. Technology used in these studies included smart phones or PCs. People who received smart technology showed greater improvement in self-management and quality of life and increased physical activity compared with people who received face-to-face/digital and/or written support over a four-week to six-month period. Also, hospital admissions and exacerbations of COPD did not differ between those who used smart technology and those who did not. Only one study provided information about people who stopped smoking and reported no differences between groups. We found only three studies all at high risk of bias - that we could include in this review, and we could conduct analysis on only two of our outcomes (quality of life and increased physical activity). As a result, we think that current information does not show clearly whether smart technology is helpful for people with COPD. We recommend further research of high quality that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD. Researchers should be clear about how self-management is assessed, should report standard trial outcomes, particularly cost, and should include follow-up for at least one year so they can provide comments on behavioural change and impact of treatment."
CD005112,"Seven randomised controlled trials were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria. In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease was refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab (three intravenous infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks) was more effective than placebo in inducing clinical remission (Relative Risk (RR) 3.22, 95% CI 2.18 to 4.76); inducing endoscopic remission (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.28); and in inducing clinical response (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.41) at 8 weeks. A single infusion of infliximab was also more effective than placebo in reducing the need for colectomy within 90 days after infusion (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.87). In patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis whose disease is refractory to conventional treatment using corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, infliximab is effective in inducing clinical remission, inducing clinical response, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy at least in the short term. Serious adverse events attributable to infliximab were not common in the included studies but physicians should be aware of and be prepared to deal with potential adverse events such as anaphylactic reactions and infections.","This review shows that intravenous infusions of infliximab, a TNF-α blocking agent is effective in inducing clinical remission, promoting mucosal healing, and reducing the need for colectomy in patients with active ulcerative colitis whose disease has not responded to conventional treatment."
CD011335,"Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this updated review. Six were from the original version of the review, and two more were added when the search was updated. Nineteen further studies were assessed as part of this update but did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Of the eight included studies, four studies investigated “prevention” of cognitive problems (during radiotherapy and follow-up) and four studies investigated “amelioration” (interventions to treat cognitive impairment as a late complication of radiotherapy). There were five pharmacological studies (two studies on prevention and three in amelioration) and three non-pharmacological studies (two on prevention and one in amelioration). Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta-analysis was not possible. Studies in early radiotherapy treatment phase (five studies)
Pharmacological studies in the “early radiotherapy treatment phase” were designed to prevent or ameliorate cognitive deficits and included drugs used in dementia (memantine) and fatigue (d-threo-methylphenidate hydrochloride). Non-pharmacological studies in the “early radiotherapy treatment phase” included a ketogenic diet and a two-week cognitive rehabilitation and problem-solving programme. In the memantine study, the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups. The d-threo-methylphenidate hydrochloride study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events. The study of a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet found no effect, although a lower than expected calorie intake in the control group complicates interpretation of the results. The study investigating the utility of a rehabilitation program did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups. Studies in delayed radiation or late effect phase (four studies)
The “amelioration” pharmacological studies to treat cognitive complications of radiotherapy included drugs used in dementia (donepezil) or psychostimulants (methylphenidate and modafinil). Non-pharmacological measures included cognitive rehabilitation and problem solving (Goal Management Training). These studies included patients with cognitive problems at entry who had “stable” brain cancer. The donepezil study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall cognitive performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported. A study comparing methylphenidate with modafinil found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported. Another  study comparing two different doses of modafinil combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported. Both studies were limited by a small sample size. The Goal Management Training study suggested a benefit of the intervention, a behavioural intervention that combined mindfulness and strategy training, on executive function and processing speed. There were a number of limitations across studies and few were without high risks of bias. In this update, limited additional evidence was found for the treatment or amelioration of cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation. As concluded in the original review, there is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation. There is supportive evidence that donepezil, methylphenidate and modafinil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation; patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of these studies. Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher certainty of evidence. There is evidence from only a single small study to support non-pharmacological interventions in the amelioration of cognitive deficits. Further research is required.","In the original review published in August 2014, we searched four literature databases, which are used to identify articles from peer-reviewed journals and other types of periodicals. Six randomised controlled trials, in which people were randomly assigned to the intervention or a comparison group (control group), were eligible for inclusion. Each trial assessed different interventions, so results were not combined. The largest trial investigated the medical drug memantine in 508 people with a metastatic brain tumour. Another trial investigated donepezil in 198 patients with a primary or secondary brain tumour. The other trials were smaller and investigated modafinil and methylphenidate. We found one psychological intervention for preventing cognitive deficits during brain radiation. In this update, we searched the same databases as in the original review. Two new studies were included in the review. One of these was a non-pharmacological prevention study investigating the effect of a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. The other identified study was a non-pharmacological amelioration study evaluating Goal Management Training, a behavioural intervention that combined mindfulness and strategy training. An additional paper included in the review was the full-text article of a conference proceeding included in the original review, which investigated donepezil compared with placebo. Findings into the efficacy of memantine offer preliminary supportive evidence for preventing cognitive deficits in patients with a secondary brain tumour receiving brain irradiation. Findings into the efficacy of donepezil offer some initial support for its use in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in patients with a primary or secondary tumour previously treated with radiation. Further research into both drugs is important to confirm their effectiveness as well as any potential side effects. The remaining studies did not have a sufficient number of participants to provide reliable results. Side effects (adverse events) were not reported in all studies, but in studies where they were, they were most often infrequent and not severe. Recruitment and retention of trial participants for most of the pharmacological studies was difficult. Lastly, although limited support was found for non-pharmacological treatments, this does not suggest these interventions are ineffective but rather that further research is needed. We found limitations in the certainty of the evidence across studies. Several of the pharmacological randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, although some were at high risk of bias due to, for example, an open-label design or the lack of a placebo group. The non-pharmacological interventions were at a high risk of bias as a placebo condition in these trials is difficult to employ."
CD007712,We identified three trials with high risk of bias which compared veno-venous bypass (n = 65) versus no veno-venous bypass (n = 66). None of the trials reported patient or graft survival. There were no significant differences regarding renal failure or blood transfusion requirements between the two groups. None of the trials reported on the morbidity related to veno-venous bypass or the requirement of veno-venous bypass in the control group. We identified one trial with high risk of bias which compared percutaneous (n = 20) versus open technique (n =19) of veno-venous bypass. The patient or graft survival was not reported. There was no difference in veno-venous bypass related morbidity between the two groups. The operating time was significantly shorter in the percutaneous technique group (MD -59 minutes; 95% CI -102 to -16). There is no evidence to support or refute the use of veno-venous bypass in liver transplantation. There is no evidence to prefer any particular technique of veno-venous bypass in liver transplantation.,We systematically searched various medical databases to determine whether veno-venous bypass is required routinely during liver transplantation. We identified a total of three randomised clinical trials with high risk of systematic error and high risk of random errors which compared veno-venous bypass (n = 65) with no veno-venous bypass (n = 66). None of the trials reported patient or graft survival. There were no differences regarding kidney failure or blood transfusion requirements between the two groups. None of the trials reported on the complications related to veno-venous bypass or the requirement of veno-venous bypass in the control group. We also identified one trial with high risk of systematic error and high risk of random errors which compared needle technique (percutaneous approach) (n = 20) with open technique (n =19) of veno-venous bypass. The patient or graft survival was not reported in this trial. There was no difference in veno-venous bypass related complications between the two groups. The operating time was shorter in the percutaneous technique group. There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of veno-venous bypass in liver transplantation.
CD008215,"We included 13 case-control and 24 cohort studies (an additional nine new cohort and two case-control studies), which included a total of 4,684,724 women. Two cohort studies reported an increased incidence of invasive ovarian cancer in exposed subfertile women compared with unexposed women. One reported a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.25) based on 17 cancer cases. The other cohort study reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.18), and this risk was increased in women remaining nulligravid after using clomiphene citrate (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.78) versus multiparous women (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.42) (very low-certainty evidence). The slight increase in ovarian cancer risk among women having between one and three cycles of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) was reported, but this was not clinically significant (P = 0.18). There was no increase in risk of invasive ovarian cancer after use of infertility drugs in women with the BRCA mutation according to one cohort and one case-control study. The certainty of evidence as assessed using GRADE was very low. For borderline ovarian tumours, one cohort study reported increased risk in exposed women with an SIR of 3.61 (95% CI 1.45 to 7.44), and this risk was greater after treatment with clomiphene citrate (SIR 7.47, 95% CI 1.54 to 21.83) based on 12 cases. In another cohort study, the risk of a borderline ovarian tumour was increased, with an HR of 4.23 (95% CI 1.25 to 14.33), for subfertile women treated with IVF compared with a non-IVF-treated group with more than one year of follow-up. A large cohort reported increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours, with HR of 2.46 (95% CI 1.20 to 5.04), and this was based on 17 cases. A significant increase in serous borderline ovarian tumours was reported in one cohort study after the use of progesterone for more than four cycles (risk ratio (RR) 2.63, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.64). A case-control study reported increased risk after clomiphene citrate was taken, with an SIR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.5) based on 11 cases, and another reported an increase especially after human menopausal gonadotrophin was taken (odds ratio (OR) 9.38, 95% CI 1.66 to 52.08). Another study estimated an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour, but this estimation was based on four cases with no control reporting use of fertility drugs. The certainty of evidence as assessed using GRADE was very low. However, although some studies suggested a slight increase in risks of ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumour, none provided moderate- or high-certainty evidence, as summarised in the GRADE tables. Since the last version of this review, only a few new relevant studies have provided additional findings with supporting evidence to suggest that infertility drugs may increase the risk of ovarian cancer slightly in subfertile women treated with infertility drugs when compared to the general population or to subfertile women not treated. The risk is slightly higher in nulliparous than in multiparous women treated with infertility drugs, and for borderline ovarian tumours. However, few studies have been conducted, the number of cancers is very small, and information on the dose or type of fertility drugs used is insufficient.","Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. A cumulative analysis of 12 case-control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two-fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow-up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow-up times."
CD012959,"We included three RCTs, involving a total of 219 adults with severe acute pancreatitis with various etiologies, including alcoholic abuse, biliary disease, high-fat diet, hyperlipidemia, etc. All of the participants had single or multiple organ failure. All of the RCTs were single-center studies conducted in China. The mean age of participants was 47.4 years. The mean proportion of females was 42.0%. All RCTs were at high risk of bias. CVVH versus no CVVH
We included two RCTs in which 189 participants with severe acute pancreatitis were randomized to undergo CVVH (97 participants) or no CVVH (92 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CVVH on in-hospital mortality (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.40; 2 studies, 189 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with no CVVH. The evidence suggests that CVVH may reduce length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (MD -8.80 days, 95% CI -10.24 to -7.36 days; 1 study, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence), length of hospital stay (MD -26.40 days, 95% CI -30.17 to -22.63 days; 1 study, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and total hospital cost (MD -2800.00 dollars, 95% CI -3881.74 to -1718.26 dollars; 1 study, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence) compared with no CVVH but the evidence is very uncertain. Adverse events and quality of life were not reported in the studies. One type ofCVVH versus a different type of CVVH
We included one RCT in which 30 participants with severe acute pancreatitis were randomized to undergo high-volume CVVH (15 participants) or standard CVVH (15 participants). High-volume CVVH may result in little to no difference in in-hospital mortality compared with standard CVVH (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.07; 1 study, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of high-volume CVVH on adverse events compared with standard CVVH (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.20; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, total hospital cost, and quality of life were not reported in the study. The certainty of the current evidence is very low or low. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CVVH on mortality in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Very low-certainty evidence suggests CVVH may reduce length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and total hospital cost but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is also very uncertain whether high-volume CVVH is superior, equivalent or inferior to standard CVVH in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.","We searched for all relevant, well-conducted studies conducted up to September 2019. We included three randomized controlled trials (experiments in which participants are randomly allocated to two or more interventions, possibly including a control intervention or no intervention, and the results are compared). We included three studies, involving a total of 219 adults with severe acute pancreatitis due to various reasons, including alcoholic abuse, biliary disease, high-fat diet, excess lipids in the blood, etc. All people had single or multiple organ failure. All of the studies were single-center studies conducted in China. The mean age of participants was 47.4 years. The mean proportion of females was 42.0%. Two studies randomized 189 people with severe acute pancreatitis to receive either CVVH (97 people) or no CVVH (92 people). One study randomized 30 people with severe acute pancreatitis to receive either high-volume (high-speed) CVVH (15 people) or standard CVVH (15 people). One study was sponsored by a non-commercial grant. The other two studies did not report on funding sources. We cannot tell from our results whether CVVH has an important effect on in-hospital deaths for people with severe acute pancreatitis because the sample size was small. CVVH may reduce length of stay in the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and total hospital cost. However, the evidence is very uncertain because both studies had some limitations and the results were imprecise. CVVH versus a different type of CVVH
High-volume CVVH may result in little to no difference in numbers of in-hospital deaths. We are uncertain whether high-volume CVVH reduces adverse events. We cannot tell from our results whether high-volume CVVH is superior, equivalent or inferior to standard CVVH for people with severe acute pancreatitis because the sample size was small and the results were imprecise. Most of the included studies had some limitations in terms of how they were conducted or reported. Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low."
CD001352,"Thirty-one published RCTs of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. The trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. Most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. More of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. There was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. Seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. Two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. One showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. Eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but any improvement in clinical outcomes is probably marginal, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. Three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. Preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. Preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions. Limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice. Surgeons should be encouraged to perform further RCTs in this field.","This review considers the available evidence on the procedures of spinal decompression (widening the spinal canal or laminectomy), nerve root decompression (of one or more individual nerves) and fusion of adjacent vertebrae. There is moderate evidence that instrumentation can increase the fusion rate, but any improvement in clinical outcomes is probably marginal. The effectiveness of intra-discal electrotherapy (IDET) remains unproven. Only preliminary results are available on disc replacement and it is not possible to draw any conclusions on this subject."
CD007989,"We included seven studies with a total of 138 participants, with data available for 123. Sample sizes ranged from 9 to 37. Judgements for categories of risk of bias varied: concerns were greatest regarding allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, and incomplete outcome data (dropout rates in the five community-based studies ranged from 3% to 54% and results were usually analysed on a per protocol basis). Participant characteristics in the seven studies were heterogeneous, but the vast majority had convictions for sexual offences, ranging from exhibitionism to rape and child molestation. Six studies examined the effectiveness of three testosterone-suppressing drugs: cyproterone acetate (CPA), ethinyl oestradiol (EO), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA); a seventh evaluated two antipsychotics (benperidol and chlorpromazine). Five studies were placebo-controlled; in two, MPA was administered as an adjunctive treatment to a psychological therapy (assertiveness training or imaginal desensitisation). Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of interventions, comparators, study designs, and other issues. The quality of the evidence overall was poor. In addition to methodological issues, much evidence was indirect. Primary outcome: recividism. Two studies reported recidivism rates formally. One trial of intramuscular MPA plus imaginal desensitisation (ID) found no reports of recividism at two-year follow-up for the intervention group (n = 10 versus one relapse within the group treated by ID alone). A three-armed trial of oral MPA, alone or in combination with psychological treatment, reported a 20% rate of recidivism amongst those in the combined treatment arm (n = 15) and 50% of those in the psychological treatment only group (n = 12). Notably, all those in the 'oral MPA only' arm of this study (n = 5) dropped out immediately, despite treatment being court mandated. Two studies did not report recidivism rates as they both took place in one secure psychiatric facility from which no participant was discharged during the study, whilst another three studies did not appear directly to measure recividism but rather abnormal sexual activity alone. Secondary outcomes:The included studies report a variety of secondary outcomes. Results suggest that the frequency of self reported deviant sexual fantasies may be reduced by testosterone-suppressing drugs, but not the deviancy itself (three studies). Where measured, hormonal levels, particularly levels of testosterone, tended to correlate with measures of sexual activity and with anxiety (two studies). One study measured anxiety formally; one study measured anger or aggression. Adverse events: Six studies provided information on adverse events. No study tested the effects of testosterone-suppressing drugs beyond six to eight months and the cross-over design of some studies may obscure matters (given the 'rebound effect' of some hormonal treatments). Considerable weight gain was reported in two trials of oral MPA and CPA. Side effects of intramuscular MPA led to discontinuation in some participants after three to five injections (the nature of these side effects was not described). Notable increases in depression and excess salivation were reported in one trial of oral MPA. The most severe side effects (extra-pyramidal movement disorders and drowsiness) were reported in a trial of antipsychotic medication for the 12 participants in the study. No deaths or suicide attempts were reported in any study. The latter is important given the association between antilibidinal hormonal medication and mood changes. We found only seven small trials (all published more than 20 years ago) that examined the effects of a limited number of drugs. Investigators reported issues around acceptance and adherence to treatment. We found no studies of the newer drugs currently in use, particularly SSRIs or GnRH analogues. Although there were some encouraging findings in this review, their limitations do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding pharmacological intervention as an effective intervention for reducing sexual offending. The tolerability, even of the testosterone-suppressing drugs, was uncertain given that all studies were small (and therefore underpowered to assess adverse effects) and of limited duration, which is not consistent with current routine clinical practice. Further research is required before it is demonstrated that their administration reduces sexual recidivism and that tolerability is maintained. It is a concern that, despite treatment being mandated in many jurisdictions, evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions is so sparse and that no RCTs appear to have been published in two decades. New studies are therefore needed and should include trials with larger sample sizes, of longer duration, evaluating newer medications, and with results stratified according to category of sexual offenders. It is important that data are collected on the characteristics of those who refuse and those who drop out, as well as those who complete treatment.","We found seven randomised trials involving 138 participants, which provided data on 123. All were male, aged between 16 and 68 years. Offending ranged from very serious (e.g., rape) to minor criminality (e.g., exhibitionism). Comparators included placebo (five studies), psychological treatment (one study), and a combination of psychological and pharmacological treatment (one study). Five studies took place in the community and two in a secure hospital. Duration varied between three and 13 months. Six studies examined the effectiveness of three testosterone-suppressing drugs: cyproterone acetate (CPA), ethinyl oestradiol (EO), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). In two of these studies, MPA was given alongside a psychological therapy (assertiveness training or imaginal desensitisation). The seventh study assessed the effectiveness of two antipsychotics (benperidol and chlorpromazine) versus placebo. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of interventions, comparator groups, study designs, and other issues. Two studies reported reoffending rates formally. One trial of intramuscular MPA plus imaginal desensitisation (ID) found no reoffending at two-year follow-up for the intervention group (n = 10 versus one relapse within the group treated by ID alone). A three-armed trial of oral MPA, alone or in combination with psychological treatment, reported a 20% rate of reoffending amongst those in the combined treatment arm (n = 15) and 50% of those in the psychological treatment only group (n = 12). Notably, all those in the 'oral MPA only' arm (n = 5) dropped out immediately, despite treatment being court mandated. Two studies did not report reoffending rates as they both took place in a secure psychiatric facility from which none were discharged. Three community studies did not formally report reoffending at all, focusing largely on 'abnormal sexual activity'. Secondary outcomes: Studies reported a variety of secondary outcomes. Results suggested that the frequency of self reported deviant sexual fantasies may be reduced by testosterone-suppressing drugs, but not the deviancy itself. Where measured, hormonal levels, particularly levels of testosterone, tended to correlate with measures of sexual activity and anxiety. One study measured anxiety formally; one study measured anger/aggression. Adverse events: Six studies provided information on adverse events and none tested the effects of testosterone-suppressing drugs beyond six to eight months. The most severe were reported in a trial of antipsychotic medication. Reported side effects in two trials of oral MPA and CPA included considerable weight gain. Side effects of intramuscular MPA led to discontinuation in some participants. Important increases in depression and excess salivation were reported in one trial of oral MPA. No deaths and no suicide attempts were reported in any study. We conclude that these seven trials (published more than 20 years ago), examining only a limited number of drugs, provide a poor evidence base to guide practice. Not only were the trials small, they were of short duration, included varied participants, and none trialled the newer drugs currently in use, particularly SSRIs or GnRH analogues. The results of this review, therefore, do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding pharmacological interventions as an effective intervention for reducing sexual offending. New studies are needed that address these deficits. Data should also be collected on the characteristics of those who refuse, drop out, and complete treatment. Overall, the quality of the evidence was poor. We had concerns about: number of participants leaving studies, blinding of those who measured outcomes, ways in which investigators concealed allocation of treatment to those delivering it, and reporting of our primary outcome: reoffending."
CD006048,"Six trials, all from the USA, involving 2343 participants, were included. A meta-analysis of four trials comparing CBT with a no-intervention control (1771 participants) reported that the relative risk of violence was 0.86 (favouring the intervention group) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.54 to 1.38. This is a small effect size, and the width of the CI suggests no clear evidence for an effect. One study (Wisconsin Study) compared CBT with process-psychodynamic group treatment and reported a relative risk of new violence of 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68). Even though the process-psychodynamic treatment did marginally better than CBT, this result is equivocal. Finally, one small study (N = 64) compared a combined CBT treatment for substance abuse and domestic violence (SADV) with a Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) group. An analysis involving 58 participants investigated the effect on reduction in frequency of physical violence episodes. The effect size was 0.30 (favouring TSF) with 95% CI from -0.22 to 0.81. There are still too few randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy for male perpetrators of domestic violence.","We included trials that involved both types of participants. The review found all randomised controlled evaluations of the effects of CBT on men's physical violence to their female partners worldwide, but there were only six small trials with a total of 2343 participants that met the inclusion criteria. The results of four of these trials, which compared men who received CBT with men getting no treatment, were combined. This was not able to show us whether or not CBT was better than no treatment. Similarly, the individual results of the other two trials, which compared CBT with another treatment, were inconclusive. Overall, the evidence from the included studies is insufficient to draw any conclusions."
CD003409,"Twenty-three trials involving 2467 people were included. Comparing methadone versus any other pharmacological treatment, we observed no clinical difference between the two treatments in terms of completion of treatment, 16 studies 1381 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.21); number of participants abstinent at follow-up, three studies, 386 participants RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.37); degree of discomfort for withdrawal symptoms and adverse events, although it was impossible to pool data for the last two outcomes. These results were confirmed also when we considered the single comparisons: methadone with: adrenergic agonists (11 studies), other opioid agonists (eight studies), anxiolytic (two studies), paiduyangsheng (one study). Comparing methadone with placebo (two studies) more severe withdrawal and more drop-outs were found in the placebo group. The results indicate that the medications used in the included studies are similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures, impairing the application of meta-analysis. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long- acting opioids, can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use.","For a tapered dose treatment to reduce withdrawal symptoms, illicit opioids are replaced by methadone or another agent using decreasing doses up to 30 days under medical supervision. The review authors searched the medical literature and identified 23 controlled trials involving 2467 adult opioid users in various countries. Trial participants were randomised to receive methadone or another pharmacological treatment. The other treatments were adrenergic agonists such as lofexidine, partial opioid agonists such as buprenorphine, opioid agonists such as LAAM (levo-α-acetyl-methadol) and the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide and buspirone. In the two studies that compared methadone with placebo, withdrawal symptoms were more severe and more people dropped out in the placebo group. The studies included in this review confirmed that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long- acting opioids, could reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. The medications used in the included studies were similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. The programs varied widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures. Seventeen of the included trials were conducted in inpatient settings."
CD007043,"Two studies were included in the review. In the one study in HIV infected women, the IUD was compared with depot progestogen or the oral contraceptive, according to the women's choice. As the majority of women chose depot progestogen, we have included this study in the review, within a mixed hormonal contraception sub-group. Overall, the copper IUD was more effective than depot progestogens/hormonal contraception at preventing pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.85). HIV disease progression was reduced in the IUD group (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96). There was no significant difference in pelvic inflammatory disease rates between the two groups. Discontinuation of the allocated method was less frequent with the IUD in one study, and less frequent with hormonal contraception in the other study (in which women were allowed to switch between various hormonal methods). In the populations studied, the IUD was more effective than hormonal contraception with respect to pregnancy prevention. High quality research is urgently needed to compare the effects, if any, of these two commonly used contraception methods on HIV acquisition/seroconversion and HIV/AIDS disease progression.","We reviewed studies that compared these two highly effective methods and found the IUD to be better at preventing pregnancy than depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Relevant to HIV positive women are the results of one small trial that found that women using the IUD for contraception where less likely to experience a worsening of their HIV disease than those using hormonal contraception. A large, high quality study is urgently needed to shed light on these findings."
CD010442,"We included 14 trials with 1863 participants. Evidence from six studies showed that self management programmes improved quality of life in people with stroke (standardised mean difference (SMD) random effects 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.41, P = 0.05; low quality evidence) and improved self efficacy (SMD, random effects 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61, P = 0.03; low quality evidence) compared with usual care. Individual studies reported benefits for health-related behaviours such as reduced use of health services, smoking, and alcohol intake, as well as improved diet and attitude. However, there was no superior effect for such programmes in the domains of locus of control, activities of daily living, medication adherence, participation, or mood. Statistical heterogeneity was mostly low; however, there was much variation in the types and delivery of programmes. Risk of bias was relatively low for complex intervention clinical trials where participants and personnel could not be blinded. The current evidence indicates that self management programmes may benefit people with stroke who are living in the community. The benefits of such programmes lie in improved quality of life and self efficacy. These are all well-recognised goals for people after stroke. There is evidence for many modes of delivery and examples of tailoring content to the target group. Leaders were usually professionals but peers (stroke survivors and carers) were also reported - the commonality is being trained and expert in stroke and its consequences. It would be beneficial for further research to be focused on identifying key features of effective self management programmes and assessing their cost-effectiveness.","We found 14 studies up to April 2016 involving 1863 participants that looked at the benefits of these programmes for people with stroke. They were conducted in a variety of countries in a variety of formats - sometimes in groups, sometimes individually, and for varying time periods. We found that such programmes may improve the quality of life after stroke. People with stroke reported improvements in their ability to live the way they wanted and that they felt more empowered to take charge of their lives, rather than be dependent on other people for their happiness and satisfaction with life. There were no reports of any risks or negative effects. The majority of the studies were well conducted and represent credible evidence that self management programmes may benefit people with stroke who are living in the community."
CD012815,"We included 30 RCTs; nine of them provided outcome data (3339 participants). Only one study included participants in the acute phase of stroke (haemorrhagic). Doses of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs ranged from 400 mg/day to 3300 mg/day. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear in most trials, with a higher risk of bias in smaller studies. We assessed results separately for short (up to three months) and longer (more than three months) follow-up studies. Short follow-up (up to three months)
Functional outcome was reported in only one pilot study as poor clinical outcome assessed with the GOSE (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.68, P = 0.52; 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Mood (assessed with the GHQ-30, lower score better) was reported by only one study and favoured control (mean difference (MD) 1.41, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.75, P = 0.04; 102 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of an effect of the intervention for the remainder of the secondary outcomes: vascular-related death (two studies, not pooled due to differences in population, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.00, P = 0.50, and RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.72, P = 0.49; 142 participants; low-certainty evidence); recurrent events (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.84, P = 0.57; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence); incidence of other type of stroke (two studies, not pooled due to different type of index stroke, RR 6.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 111.71, P = 0.22, and RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.58, P = 0.32; 58 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and quality of life (physical component, MD −2.31, 95% CI −4.81 to 0.19, P = 0.07, and mental component, MD −2.16, 95% CI −5.91 to 1.59, P = 0.26; 1 study; 102 participants; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were reported by two studies (57 participants; very low-certainty evidence), one trial reporting extracranial haemorrhage (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.73, P = 0.16) and the other one reporting bleeding complications (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.35, P = 0.47). Longer follow-up (more than three months)
One small trial assessed functional outcome with both the Barthel Index for activities of daily living (MD 7.09, 95% CI −5.16 to 19.34, P = 0.26), and the Rivermead Mobility Index for mobility (MD 1.30, 95% CI −1.31 to 3.91, P = 0.33) (52 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We carried out meta-analysis for vascular-related death (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35, P = 0.86; 5 studies; 2237 participants; low-certainty evidence) and fatal recurrent events (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.55, P = 0.37; 3 studies; 1819 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of an effect of the intervention for mood (MD 1.00, 95% CI −2.07 to 4.07, P = 0.61; 1 study; 14 participants; low-certainty evidence). Incidence of other type of stroke and quality of life were not reported. Adverse events (all combined) were reported by only one study (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.58, P = 0.82; 1455 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs therapy on functional outcomes and dependence after stroke as there is insufficient high-certainty evidence. More well-designed RCTs are needed, specifically in acute stroke, to determine the efficacy and safety of the intervention. Studies assessing functional outcome might consider starting the intervention as early as possible after the event, as well as using standardised, clinically relevant measures for functional outcomes, such as the modified Rankin Scale. Optimal doses remain to be determined; delivery forms (type of lipid carriers) and mode of administration (ingestion or injection) also need further consideration.","We identified 30 studies that included participants with stroke or TIA and we found relevant information in nine of them (3339 participants in total). Three had a short follow-up (up to three months) and six had a longer follow-up. Three studies compared marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids to normal care and the remainder used a placebo (dummy). Not all of the studies assessed all outcomes. The effects of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids on stroke recovery are unclear. Only two very small studies reported it, one in each follow-up category, without finding meaningful differences. One study in the short follow-up group found less improvement in mood with marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids but the evidence was of low certainty. The effect of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids on deaths due to blood vessel disease, recurrence of stroke, adverse events, and quality of life after having a stroke or TIA is unclear in both follow-up categories, due to the small number of studies that have assessed them. In both the short and longer follow-up studies the certainty of the evidence was very low or low. The frequency of other type of stroke and quality of life were not reported in the longer follow-up. This review updates one carried out originally in 2019. It is now up to date to 31 May 2021."
CD001276,"Seven trials met the inclusion criteria (380 participants). Methodological quality was high. All studies recruited children with acute severe asthma and requiring hospital admission. Six studies sought participants who were unresponsive to nebulised short-acting beta-agonist and administered systemic steroids to study participants. In two studies where some children were able to perform spirometry, baseline FEV1 was between 35 and 45% predicted. The addition of aminophylline to steroids and ß2-agonist significantly improved FEV1% predicted over placebo at 6-8 hours, 12-18 hours and 24 hours. Aminophylline led to a greater improvement in PEF% predicted over placebo at 12-18 hours. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, symptoms, frequency of nebulisations and mechanical ventilation rates. There were insufficient data to permit aggregation for oxygenation and duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. Aminophylline led to a three-fold increase in the risk of vomiting. There was no significant difference between treatment groups with regard to hypokalaemia, headaches, tremor, seizures, arrhythmias and deaths. In children with a severe asthma exacerbation, the addition of intravenous aminophylline to ß2-agonists and glucocorticoids (with or without anticholinergics) improves lung function within 6 hours of treatment. However there is no apparent reduction in symptoms, number of nebulised treatment and length of hospital stay. There is insufficient evidence to assess the impact on oxygenation, PICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Aminophylline is associated with a significant increased risk of vomiting.","The purpose of this review was to assess whether the use of intravenous aminophylline in children receiving maximised inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids produced additional beneficial effects. We identified a small number of good quality trials which compared aminophylline with placebo in children given inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoid therapy. This review found evidence that children treated with aminophylline had a greater improvement in lung function than children treated with placebo, when both groups received inhaled bronchodilators and steroids and they responded incompletely to these initial therapies. However, aminophylline use also resulted in greater risk of vomiting. Aminophylline use in children may be appropriate if children have a role in severe acute exacerbations of asthma where response to maximised therapy (inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids) is poor. These results are based on small numbers and further work in this area is required."
CD012671,"We included four studies (enrolling 581 neonates) in the review. All four studies were conducted in tertiary care hospitals in India. Three of the four studies included neonates born at and beyond term gestation, whereas one included neonates born at and beyond 34 weeks of gestation. Due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind the healthcare personnel conducting the intervention. Tracheal suction compared to no suction in non-vigorous neonates born through MSAF
In non-vigorous infants, no differences were noted in the risks of MAS (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.08; 4 studies, 581 neonates) or all-cause neonatal mortality (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.02; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07; 4 studies, 575 neonates) with or without tracheal suctioning. No differences were reported in the risk of any severity HIE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.63; 1 study, 175 neonates) or moderate to severe HIE (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.09; 1 study, 152 neonates) among non-vigorous neonates born through MSAF. We are also uncertain as to the effect of tracheal suction on other outcomes such as incidence of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.44; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; 4 studies, 581 neonates), pulmonary air leaks (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.93; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; 3 studies, 449 neonates), persistent pulmonary hypertension (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.77; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; 3 studies, 406 neonates) and culture-positive sepsis (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.57; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; 3 studies, 406 neonates). All reported outcomes were judged as providing very low certainty evidence. We are uncertain about the effect of tracheal suction on the incidence of MAS and its complications among non-vigorous neonates born through MSAF. One study awaits classification and could not be included in the review. More research from well-conducted large trials is needed to conclusively answer the review question.","We included four studies (581 neonates) conducted in hospitals in India. Three trials included neonates born at and beyond term gestation, whereas one included neonates born at and beyond 34 weeks of gestation. All four studies identified eligible neonates by the presence of at least one of the following at birth: no breathing or crying, poor muscle tone, and heart rate less than 100 beats per minute. The intervention consisted of tracheal suction at the time of birth with an intent to clear the trachea of meconium before regular breathing efforts began. Neonates in the control group were resuscitated at birth with no effort made to clear the trachea of meconium. The search was up-to-date to 25 November 2020. We are uncertain as to the effect of tracheal suction in reducing the risk of MAS. For every 1000 neonates in whom tracheal suction is done, MAS may be observed in 70 fewer to 80 more neonates. Similarly, we are uncertain as to the effect of tracheal suction on the risk of death before discharge from the hospital (22 fewer to 92 more per 1000 neonates). We are also uncertain as to the effect of tracheal suction on the risks of other outcomes, such as the need for advanced resuscitation measures; encephalopathy (brain damage or disease) due to asphyxia (a lack of oxygen that results in unconsciousness and often death); the need for or duration of mechanical ventilation; the need for non-invasive respiratory support (a mask); duration of oxygen therapy; and duration of hospitalisation. These and other complications of MAS were not different with or without tracheal suction. There was very low certainty evidence from the four studies included in this review. Firstly, in most of the studies, the healthcare workers who provided the clinical care or decided the presence of outcomes were aware of the study group assignment of the babies, thus increasing the risk of bias. Secondly, due to the small size of the studies and the low incidences of the outcomes, we had low confidence in ruling out clinically important benefits or harms when tracheal suction was performed. One study awaits classification and could not be included in the review. More research from well-conducted large trials is needed to conclusively answer the research question."
CD010703,"A total of 14 RCTs, with 4732 participants, were included in this review covering short-term (≤ 4 weeks; 6 studies), medium-term (> 4 weeks ≤ 6 months; 6 studies) and long-term treatment (> 6 months; 2 studies) with eszopiclone. Most RCTs included in the review included participants aged between 18 and 64 years, three RCTs only included elderly participants (64 to 85 years) and one RCT included participants with a broader age range (35 to 85 years). Seven studies considered primary insomnia; the remaining studies considered secondary insomnia comorbid with depression (2), generalised anxiety (1), back pain (1), Parkinson's disease (1), rheumatoid arthritis (1) and menopausal transition (1). Meta-analytic integrations of participant-reported data on sleep efficacy outcomes demonstrated better results for eszopiclone compared to placebo: a 12-minute decrease of sleep onset latency (mean difference (MD) -11.94 min, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.03 to -7.86; 9 studies, 2890 participants, moderate quality evidence), a 17-minute decrease of wake time after sleep onset (MD -17.02 min, 95% CI -24.89 to -9.15; 8 studies, 2295 participants, moderate quality evidence) and a 28-minute increase of total sleep time (MD 27.70 min, 95% CI 20.30 to 35.09; 10 studies, 2965 participants, moderate quality evidence). There were no significant changes from baseline to the first three nights after drug discontinuation for sleep onset latency (MD 17.00 min, 95% CI -4.29 to 38.29; 1 study, 291 participants, low quality evidence) and wake time after sleep onset (MD -6.71 min, 95% CI -21.25 to 7.83; 1 study, 291 participants, low quality evidence). Adverse events during treatment that were documented more frequently under eszopiclone compared to placebo included unpleasant taste (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.21; 9 studies, 3787 participants), dry mouth (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 6 studies, 2802 participants), somnolence (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 8 studies, 3532 participants) and dizziness (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; 7 studies, 2933 participants). According to the GRADE criteria, evidence was rated as being of moderate quality for sleep efficacy outcomes and adverse events and of low quality for rebound effects and next-day functioning. Eszopiclone appears to be an efficient drug with moderate effects on sleep onset and maintenance. There was no or little evidence of harm if taken as recommended. However, as certain patient subgroups were underrepresented in RCTs included in the review, findings might not have displayed the entire spectrum of possible adverse events. Further, increased caution is required in elderly individuals with cognitive and motor impairments and individuals who are at increased risk of using eszopiclone in a non-recommended way.","On average, people taking eszopiclone fell asleep 12 minutes faster than those taking placebo, were 17 minutes less awake during the night and had, in total, about half an hour more sleep than people in the placebo group. As side effects, eszopiclone can cause unpleasant taste, dizziness, dry mouth, and tiredness during the day. Clinical studies did not find evidence that eszopiclone was causing serious harm or withdrawal symptoms or whether it was addictive if it was stopped and not taken after several weeks or months of treatment. Nevertheless, as clinical studies included in the review did not cover certain groups (e.g. elderly people with cognitive or motor problems or certain conditions of medication intake), it is important for patients to consult their doctor who knows their medical history and condition. Future research needs to compare eszopiclone with other sleep medications to help physicians and patients decide which of the available treatment options to prefer. In addition, sleep medications that are also well tolerated by elderly individuals and individuals with alcohol or drug problems need to be identified."
CD001401,"We included 11 cross-over studies (153 participants) and one parallel study (41 participants). There were differences between studies in how the interventions were delivered, with several intervention groups combining more than one ACT. One study used autogenic drainage; five used conventional chest physiotherapy; nine used positive expiratory pressure (PEP), with one study varying the water pressure between arms; three studies used oscillating PEP; two used exercise; and two used high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO). Of the 12 included studies, 10 were single-treatment studies, and two delivered the intervention over two consecutive days (once daily in one study, twice daily in the second). This substantial heterogeneity in the treatment interventions precluded pooling of data for meta-analysis. Blinding of participants, caregivers, and clinicians is impossible in airway clearance studies; we therefore judged all studies at unclear risk of performance bias. Lack of information in eight studies made assessment of risk of bias unclear for most other domains. We rated the certainty of evidence as low or very low due to the short-term cross-over trial design, small numbers of participants, and uncertain risk of bias across most or all domains. Six studies (84 participants) reported no effect on pulmonary function variables following intervention; but one study (14 participants) reported an improvement in pulmonary function following the intervention in some of the treatment groups. Two studies reported lung clearance index: one (41 participants) found a variable response to treatment with HFCWO, whilst another (15 participants) found no effect on lung clearance index with PEP therapy (low-certainty evidence). Five studies (55 participants) reported that ACTs, including coughing, increased radioactive tracer clearance compared to control, while a further study (eight participants) reported no improvement in radioactive tracer clearance when comparing PEP to control, although coughing was discouraged during the PEP intervention. We rated the certainty of evidence on the effect of ACTs on radioactive tracer clearance as very low. Four studies (46 participants) investigated the weight of mucus cleared from the lungs and reported greater secretions during chest physiotherapy compared to a control. One study (18 participants) reported no differences in sputum weight (very low-certainty evidence). The evidence from this review shows that ACTs may have short-term effects on increasing mucus transport in people with CF. All included studies had short-term follow-up; consequently, we were unable to draw any conclusions on the long-term effects of ACTs compared to no ACTs in people with CF. The evidence in this review represents the use of airway clearance techniques in a CF population before widespread use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of airway clearance in those treated with highly effective CFTR modulators.","We included 12 studies that enrolled 194 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were very different and some looked at multiple treatments compared to no treatment. One study used autogenic drainage (a controlled breathing technique which uses different speeds and depths of exhaled breath to move mucus up the airways so it can be cleared by coughing); five studies used conventional chest physiotherapy (manual techniques of percussion and vibration applied to the chest wall, usually with the assistance of a physiotherapist or relative); nine used positive expiratory pressure (breathing out through a mask or mouthpiece against a resistance which causes pressure to build up in the lungs to move the mucus), and one of these varied pressure so used both standard and high-pressure positive expiratory pressure; three studies used oscillating positive expiratory pressure (positive expiratory pressure combined with vibrations within the airway to loosen mucus); two used exercise (on a treadmill); and two used high-frequency chest wall oscillation (high frequency vibrations applied outside the chest wall via an inflatable garment). We could not combine any results to analyse them statistically. Summarising the findings of the 12 studies, we found limited evidence of a short-term impact on lung function. Only one study reported an improvement in lung function in some of the treatment groups, whilst six other studies found no improvement. This review found that methods of clearing the airways may have short-term benefits for moving mucus. Four studies found that the people using airway clearance techniques coughed up more sputum, but one study reported no difference with or without using an airway clearance technique. Five studies reported increased radioactive tracer clearance (a test in which people are imaged continuously after inhaling a radioaerosol to assess the time for it to be cleared from the lung) when using airway clearance, but one study of positive expiratory pressure found no difference. At present, there is no clear evidence to show the long-term effects of performing airway clearance techniques on quality of life or survival. We have little or very little confidence in the evidence, for several reasons. Most included studies had design problems, and in just under half of the studies, it was unclear whether all the results were reported. Also, in physiotherapy studies, the person receiving treatment and their physiotherapist know which treatment they are receiving, and this may affect some of the findings. For example, the amount of mucus coughed up and lung function tests (measured by half of the included studies) and a person's views on a particular technique (recorded in a quarter of the included studies) may be affected if a person is aware of which treatment they are receiving. Finally, it was not clear in most studies whether the individual was experienced with the technique they were using. We were unable to find any studies looking at the effects of airway clearance techniques in people treated with the new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator treatments. Cystic fibrosis is caused by faulty proteins on the cell surface made by the mutated CFTR gene; these new medicines are designed to correct the function of the faulty proteins."
CD009658,"We identified 12 RCTs and one quasi-RCT (6923 participants), six for cardiac surgery (3359 participants) and seven for thoracic surgery (3564 participants). No study evaluated fondaparinux, the new oral direct thrombin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, or caval filters. All studies had major study design flaws and most lacked a placebo or no treatment control group. We typically graded the quality of the overall body of evidence for the various outcomes and comparisons as low, due to imprecise estimates of effect and risk of bias. We could not pool data because of the different comparisons and the lack of data. In cardiac surgery, 71 symptomatic VTEs occurred in 3040 participants from four studies. In a study of 2551 participants, representing 85% of the review population in cardiac surgery, the combination of unfractionated heparin with pneumatic compression stockings was associated with a 61% reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to unfractionated heparin alone (1.5% versus 4.0%; risk ratio (RR) 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.64). Major bleeding was only reported in one study, which found a higher incidence with vitamin K antagonists compared to platelet inhibitors (11.3% versus 1.6%, RR 7.06; 95% CI 1.64 to 30.40). In thoracic surgery, 15 symptomatic VTEs occurred in 2890 participants from six studies. In the largest study evaluating unfractionated heparin versus an inactive control the rates of symptomatic VTE were 0.7% versus 0%, respectively, giving a RR of 6.71 (95% CI 0.40 to 112.65). There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in the risk of major bleeding from two studies evaluating fixed-dose versus weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (2.7% versus 8.1%, RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.60) and unfractionated heparin versus low molecular weight heparin (6% and 4%, RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.60). The evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in cardiac and thoracic surgery is limited. Data for important outcomes such as pulmonary embolism or major bleeding were often lacking. Given the uncertainties around the benefit-to-risk balance, no conclusions can be drawn and a case-by-case risk evaluation of VTE and bleeding remains preferable.","We identified 13 randomised controlled trials (6923 participants), six for cardiac surgery (3359 participants) and seven for thoracic surgery (3564 participants). The evidence is current to May 2014. No study evaluated fondaparinux, the new oral direct thrombin or direct factor Xa inhibitors, or caval filters. Data could not be combined because of the different comparisons and the lack of data. Data for clinically relevant outcomes such as pulmonary embolism (blockage of one or more arteries of the lung) or major bleeding were often lacking. In cardiac surgery, symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 71 out of 3040 participants from three studies. In a study of 2551 participants, representing 85% of the review population in cardiac surgery, the combination of unfractionated heparin with intermittent pneumatic compression was associated with an important reduction of symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared to unfractionated heparin alone. Major (important) bleeding was reported in one study only, and the best estimate was that bleedings occurred seven times more often in participants on vitamin K antagonists compared to participants on platelet inhibitors, but the true estimate may lay between one and a half to 30. In thoracic surgery, symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 15 out of 2890 participants from six studies. Combined analysis could not be performed, but the largest study evaluating unfractionated heparin versus an inactive control did not show a benefit in terms of reduced occurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. Major bleeding was reported in two studies that did not find significantly different rates between fixed-dose and weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (2.7% versus 8.1%) and between unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (6% and 4%). Overall, the evidence on the use of thromboprophylaxis in cardiac and thoracic surgery appeared to be scarce, so we are very uncertain about the benefit-to-risk balance. All studies had major study design flaws and most lacked a placebo or no treatment control group. We typically graded the quality of the overall body of evidence for the various outcomes and comparisons as low, due to imprecise estimates of effect and risk of bias. Our data suggest that thromboprophylaxis cannot be suggested for all patients undergoing these types of surgery, but should rather be considered case-by-case based on the individual risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding."
CD006056,"We included nine RCTs with 1208 patients; 622 patients were randomized to a PS spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and 586 to a T-tube SBT. The studies were classified into three categories of weaning: simple, difficult, and prolonged. Four studies placed patients in two categories of weaning. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) and a T-tube were used directly as SBTs in four studies (844 patients, 69.9% of the sample). In 186 patients (15.4%) both interventions were used along with gradual weaning from mechanical ventilation; the PS was gradually decreased, twice a day, until it was minimal and periods with a T-tube were gradually increased to two and eight hours for patients with difficult and prolonged weaning. In two studies (14.7% of patients) the PS was lowered to 2 to 4 cm H2O and 3 to 5 cm H2O based on ventilatory parameters until the minimal PS levels were reached. PS was then compared to the trial with the T-tube (TT). We identified 33 different reported outcomes in the included studies; we took 14 of them into consideration and performed meta-analyses on nine. With regard to the sequence of allocation generation, allocation concealment, selective reporting and attrition bias, no study presented a high risk of bias. We found no clear evidence of a difference between PS and TT for weaning success (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17, 9 studies, low quality of evidence), intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.23, 5 studies, low quality of evidence), reintubation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26, 7 studies, low quality evidence), ICU and long-term weaning unit (LWU) length of stay (MD -7.08 days, 95% CI -16.26 to 2.1, 2 studies, low quality of evidence) and pneumonia (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.85, 2 studies, low quality of evidence). PS was significantly superior to the TT for successful SBTs (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, 4 studies, moderate quality of evidence). Four studies reported on weaning duration, however we were unable to combined the study data because of differences in how the studies presented their data. One study was at high risk of other bias and four studies were at high risk for detection bias. Three studies reported that the weaning duration was shorter with PS, and in one study the duration was shorter in patients with a TT. To date, we have found evidence of generally low quality from studies comparing pressure support ventilation (PSV) and with a T-tube. The effects on weaning success, ICU mortality, reintubation, ICU and LWU length of stay, and pneumonia were imprecise. However, PSV was more effective than a T-tube for successful spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) among patients with simple weaning. Based on the findings of single trials, three studies presented a shorter weaning duration in the group undergoing PS SBT, however a fourth study found a shorter weaning duration with a T-tube.","Previous studies and systematic reviews suggest that a weaning protocol should be implemented in order to make daily assessments of patients who may be ready for weaning from mechanical ventilation. The ability to breathe spontaneously can be assessed with a spontaneous breathing trial using a T-tube (T-piece) or by reducing the applied airway pressure to provide low levels of pressure support (PS) (5 to 10 cm H2O). After removal of the endotracheal tube (extubation) the patients are monitored for 48 hours. If over this period ventilatory support does not need to be reintroduced, this is taken to indicate successful weaning. For this Cochrane systematic review we searched the medical literature databases until June 2012 and included nine studies with 1208 adult patients who had been on invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours. The trials compared pressure support (PS) and the use of a T-tube (622 patients randomized to PS and 586 randomized to a T-tube). There was no clear evidence to confirm that PS was superior to a T-tube with regard to the success of weaning, need for reintubation, ICU mortality, and other factors including long-term weaning unit (LWU) length of stay, pneumonia and a rapid shallow breathing index. Among patients who received PS, a greater number of patients had a successful spontaneous breathing trial and the airway tube was removed. For respiratory rate and tidal volume outcomes PS was superior to using a T-tube in two trials. Three studies reported that the weaning duration was shorter during PS, and in one study in which patients submitted to a T-tube the weaning time was shorter. Because of limitations in the design of the studies and imprecision in the effect estimates we have rated the quality of the evidence to be low. We reran the search in December 2013. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review."
CD003773,"We identified 15 studies (1550 patients). CRRT did not differ from IRRT with respect to in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12), ICU mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.26), number of surviving patients not requiring RRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), haemodynamic instability (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.28) or hypotension (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16) and need for escalation of pressor therapy (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.08). Patients on CRRT were likely to have significantly higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) (MD 5.35, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.29) and higher risk of clotting dialysis filters (RR, 95% CI 8.50 CI 1.14 to 63.33). In patients who are haemodynamically stable, the RRT modality does not appear to influence important patient outcomes, and therefore the preference for CRRT over IRRT in such patients does not appear justified in the light of available evidence. CRRT was shown to achieve better haemodynamic parameters such as MAP. Future research should focus on factors such as the dose of dialysis and evaluation of newer promising hybrid technologies such as SLED. Triallists should follow the recommendations regarding clinical endpoints assessment in RCTs in ARF made by the Working Group of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Working Group.","Our systematic review identified 15 randomised studies with 1550 patients comparing CRRT with IRRT. We did not find any difference between CRRT and IRRT with respect to mortality, renal recovery, and risk of haemodynamic instability or hypotension episodes."
CD012569,"We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with a mean baseline age from 51.5 to 74.2 years. Follow-up duration ranged from four weeks to 36.6 months. There was no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for the outcomes: all-cause mortality: risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.18; 5 RCTs, 5962 participants; low-certainty evidence; total myocardial infarction: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.39; 2 RCTs, 957 participants; very low-certainty evidence; adverse events: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants;  moderate-certainty evidence; serious adverse events: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; low-certainty evidence; and withdrawal due to adverse effects: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.06; 10 RTCs, 6008 participants; low-certainty evidence. No data were available for total cardiovascular events, heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease or change in heart rate. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduced systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) −1.72, 95% CI −2.47 to −0.97; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants;  and diastolic blood pressure: MD −1.18, 95% CI −1.65 to −0.72; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants,  to a greater extent than ACE inhibitors, but we judged this to be more likely due to bias than a true effect. For the treatment of hypertension, we have low certainty that renin inhibitors (RI) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not differ for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. We have low to moderate certainty that they do not differ for adverse events. Small reductions in blood pressure with renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors are of low certainty. More independent, large, long-term trials are needed to compare RIs with ACE inhibitors, particularly assessing morbidity and mortality outcomes, but also on blood pressure-lowering effect.","We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) for this review. We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with an average age from 51 to 74 years. Length of follow-up ranged from four weeks to 36 months. Low-certainty evidence showed no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for deaths from any cause, for heart attacks, for serious side effects or for leaving the study because of side effects. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduce blood pressure more than ACE inhibitors do, but this could have been due to bias in the design and conduct of the studies. More independent RCTs are needed to assess illnesses and deaths, and to see if the difference in blood pressure-lowering is real."
CD008328,"Twenty-eight studies on 907 participants were included in the review. Study sample size was generally small (range 5 to 96 people) and overall quality was generally poor due to inadequate blinding and allocation procedures. Meta-analyses were limited by heterogeneity of outcome measurement and inadequate reporting of data. In people experiencing AECOPD, ACT use was associated with small but significant short-term reductions in the need for increased ventilatory assistance (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.85; data from four studies on 171 people), the duration of ventilatory assistance (mean difference (MD) -2.05 days, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.51; mean duration for control groups seven days; data from two studies on 54 people) and hospital length of stay (MD -0.75 days, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.11; mean duration for control groups nine days; one study on 35 people). Data from a limited number of studies revealed no significant long-term benefits of ACTs on the number of exacerbations or hospitalisations, nor any short-term beneficial effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -2.30, 95% CI -11.80 to 7.20; one study on 59 people). In people with stable COPD, data from single studies revealed no significant short-term benefit of ACTs on the number of people with exacerbations (OR 3.21, 95% CI 0.12 to 85.20; one study on 30 people), significant short-term improvements in HRQoL as measured by the SGRQ total score (MD -6.10, 95% CI -8.93 to -3.27; one study on 15 people) and a reduced long-term need for respiratory-related hospitalisation (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.95; one study on 35 participants). The magnitude of effect of PEP-based ACTs on the need for increased ventilatory assistance and hospital length of stay was greater than for non-PEP ACTs, however we found no statistically significant subgroup differences. There was one report of vomiting during treatment with postural drainage and head-down tilt. Evidence from this review indicates that airway clearance techniques are safe for individuals with COPD and confer small beneficial effects on some clinical outcomes. Consideration may be given to the use of airway clearance techniques for patients with COPD in both acute and stable disease, however current studies suggest that the benefits achieved may be small.","This review comprised 28 studies of 907 participants, with the quality of evidence being generally poor. Performing ACTs during an acute flare-up of COPD reduced the likelihood of needing mechanical assistance to breathe, as well as the length of time for which it was required. Time spent in hospital was slightly reduced, but there was little evidence to suggest any benefit on future flare-ups or health-related quality of life. Performing ACTs during stable COPD did not appear to affect flare-ups or hospitalisations, however it may improve health-related quality of life. Techniques which involve breathing out against a positive expiratory pressure resistance may provide greater benefits than other types of ACTs. The lack of adverse events observed in this review suggests that ACTs are safe for individuals with COPD."
CD005405,"We included three trials examining pulmonary exacerbations (171 participants) and two trials examining long-term therapy (85 participants). We regarded the most important outcomes as quality of life and lung function. The analysis did not identify any statistically significant difference between oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments for these outcome measures for either pulmonary exacerbations or long-term treatment. One of the included trials reported significantly better lung function when treating a pulmonary exacerbation with ciprofloxacin when compared with intravenous treatment; however, our analysis did not confirm this finding. We found no evidence of difference between oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments regarding adverse events or development of antibiotic resistance, but trials were not adequately powered to detect this. None of the studies had a low risk of bias from blinding which may have an impact particularly on subjective outcomes such as quality of life. The risk of bias for other criteria could not be clearly stated across the studies. We found no conclusive evidence that an oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotic regimen is more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either pulmonary exacerbations or long-term treatment of chronic infection with P. aeruginosa. Until results of adequately-powered future trials are available, treatment needs to be selected on a pragmatic basis, based upon any available non-randomised evidence, the clinical circumstances of the individual, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains and upon individual preference.","We included five trials with 256 participants. Three trials included people experiencing a flare up of disease (171 participants) and two trials looked at long-term therapy (85 participants). We found no conclusive evidence to show that oral antibiotics were more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either flare ups of disease or long-term treatment of chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of the trials with volunteers being treated for a flare up of disease reported significantly better lung function when using ciprofloxacin compared with intravenous treatment; but we did not agree with this finding when we analysed the same data. We did not find any evidence of differences between oral antibiotics and other treatments in terms of adverse events or the development of antibiotic resistance, but we do note that the trials were not designed to detect such differences. Until the results of large trials are available, people should choose their treatment on a practical basis, basing decisions on any available evidence, their clinical circumstances, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains of the bug and individual preference. The evidence we found was limited. The trials were very different in terms of design, drugs used, length of treatment and follow up and the outcomes measured. We judged the trials to be at different risks of bias, but we did not think any of them had a low risk of bias from blinding, which might affect the results of subjective outcomes like quality of life."
CD013636,"We included 37 RCTs (57,079 participants). There is consistent high-quality evidence from RCTs that reducing total fat intake results in small reductions in body fatness; this was seen in almost all included studies and was highly resistant to sensitivity analyses (GRADE high-quality evidence, not downgraded). The effect of eating less fat (compared with higher fat intake) is a mean body weight reduction of 1.4 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.7 to -1.1 kg, in 53,875 participants from 26 RCTs, I2 = 75%). The heterogeneity was explained in subgrouping and meta-regression. These suggested that greater weight loss results from greater fat reductions in people with lower fat intake at baseline, and people with higher body mass index (BMI) at baseline. The size of the effect on weight does not alter over time and is mirrored by reductions in BMI (MD -0.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.3, 46,539 participants in 14 trials, I2 = 21%), waist circumference (MD -0.5 cm, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.2, 16,620 participants in 3 trials; I2 = 21%), and percentage body fat (MD -0.3% body fat, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.00, P = 0.05, in 2350 participants in 2 trials; I2 = 0%). There was no suggestion of harms associated with low fat diets that might mitigate any benefits on body fatness. The reduction in body weight was reflected in small reductions in LDL (-0.13 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.05), and total cholesterol (-0.23 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.14), with little or no effect on HDL cholesterol (-0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00), triglycerides (0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.07), systolic (-0.75 mmHg, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.07) or diastolic blood pressure(-0.52 mmHg, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.09), all GRADE high-quality evidence or quality of life (0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.07, on a scale of 0 to 10, GRADE low-quality evidence). Trials where participants were randomised to a lower fat intake versus a higher fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed a consistent, stable but small effect of low fat intake on body fatness: slightly lower weight, BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat compared with higher fat arms. Greater fat reduction, lower baseline fat intake and higher baseline BMI were all associated with greater reductions in weight. There was no evidence of harm to serum lipids, blood pressure or quality of life, but rather of small benefits or no effect.","This review looked at the effect of cutting down the proportion of energy from fat in our food on body fatness in adults who are not aiming to lose weight. Body fatness was measured using body weight, body mass index, waist circumference and percent body fatness. The evidence is current to October 2019. The review found that cutting down on the proportion of fat in our food leads to a small but noticeable decrease in body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat and waist circumference. The effect did not change over time, but reducing fat intake to a greater extent results in greater weight reduction. We assessed potential harms of reducing total fat, but found no evidence of harm on serum lipids, blood pressure or quality of life."
CD006483,"We identified 15 RCTs of ICBI conducted in various settings and populations (3917 participants). Comparing ICBI to 'minimal interventions' such as usual practice, meta-analyses showed statistically significant effects as follows: moderate effect on sexual health knowledge (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.18); small effect on safer sex self-efficacy (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29); small effect on safer-sex intentions (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30); and also an effect on sexual behaviour (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.59). Data were insufficient for meta-analysis of biological outcomes and analysis of cost-effectiveness. In comparison with face-to-face sexual health interventions, meta-analysis was only possible for sexual health knowledge, showing that ICBI were more effective (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58). Two further trials reported no difference in knowledge between ICBI and face-to-face intervention, but data were not available for pooling. There were insufficient data to analyse other types of outcome. No studies measured potential harms (apart from reporting any deterioration in measured outcomes). ICBI are effective tools for learning about sexual health, and they also show positive effects on self-efficacy, intention and sexual behaviour. More research is needed to establish whether ICBI can impact on biological outcomes, to understand how interventions might work, and whether they are cost-effective.","We searched databases for studies which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of computer/Internet-based interventions which aimed to improve sexual health. We included trials of computer-based interventions delivered to people of any age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity or nationality. The review evaluated 15 RCTs involving 3917 participants. Results showed that computer-based interventions have a moderate effect in improving people's knowledge about sexual health in comparison to minimal interventions such as ‘usual practice' or a leaflet. We also found a small effect on safer sex self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action), a small effect on safer-sex intentions, and also an effect on sexual behaviour (such as condom use for sexual intercourse). We found that computer-based interventions seem better than face-to-face interventions at improving sexual health knowledge, but there were insufficient data to analyse other outcomes. No studies measured potential harms (apart from reporting any deterioration in outcomes). Interactive computer-based interventions for sexual health promotion are feasible in a variety of settings. They are effective tools for learning about sexual health, and they also improve self-efficacy, intention and sexual behaviour, but more research is needed to establish whether computer-based interventions can change outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, to understand how interventions might work, and to assess whether they are cost-effective."
CD013565,"We found three RCTs including a total of 1162 women. Our GRADE assessment of the overall certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Utilization rate at six months may be slightly higher for immediate compared with delayed insertion (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15; 3 RCTs; 1103 women; I2 = 62%; low certainty evidence). Unintended pregnancy within six months after abortion was probably lower with immediate insertion compared with delayed insertion (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.77; 3 RCTs; 1029 women; I2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). Immediate insertion of contraceptive implants probably improves the initiation rate compared to delayed insertion following medical abortion (RR 1.26 for medical abortion, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.32; 2 RCTs; 1014 women; I2 = 89%; moderate certainty evidence) and may also improve initiation following surgical abortion (RR 2.32 for surgical abortion, 95% CI 1.79 to 3.01; 1 RCT; 148 women; I2 = not applicable; low certainty evidence). We did not pool results for the implant initiation outcome over both abortion types because of very high statistical heterogeneity. For medical termination of pregnancy, we found there is probably little or no difference between immediate and delayed insertion in overall failure of medical abortion (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.40; 2 RCTs; 1001 women; I2 = 68%;moderate certainty evidence). There may be no difference between immediate and delayed insertion on rates of abnormal bleeding at one month after abortion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.14; 1 RCT; 462 women; I2 = not applicable; low certainty evidence). Provision of progestin-releasing implants concurrently with abortifacient agents likely has little or no negative impact on overall failure rate of medical abortion. Immediate insertion probably improves the initiation rate of contraceptive implant, as well as unintended pregnancy rate within six months after abortion, compared to delayed insertion. There may be no difference between immediate and delayed insertion approaches in bleeding adverse effects at one month after abortion.","We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) up to March 2021. We looked at whether insertion of contraceptive implants at the same visit as abortion compared with at the time women returned for a follow-up visit affected the use of this contraceptive method. We included three studies with a total of 1162 women selecting implant contraception following an abortion assigned to immediate insertion at the visit or at a follow-up visit. Use of a contraceptive implant may be higher when it is inserted at the same visit as abortion. The evidence suggests that immediate insertion probably improves the initiation of contraceptive implants. However, immediate insertion may slightly increase the utilization rate at six months. There appeared to be little or no difference between groups in overall failure rate of medical abortion and bleeding side effects at one month after abortion. The evidence also indicates that immediate insertion of contraceptive implants probably reduces unintended pregnancy rate within six months after abortion. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low. Further good-quality, well-designed randomized controlled trials will provide meaningful results on the rates of unintended pregnancy, and side effects following contraceptive implant placement at the same visit as abortion, compared to insertion within six weeks after."
CD011563,"We included 10 trials with a total of 787 participants. The number of randomised participants ranged from 40 to 199 per comparison. Eight studies included participants with both primary and incisional ventral hernia. One study included only participants with umbilical hernia, and another only participants with incisional hernia. Hernia size varied between studies. We judged the risk of bias as moderate to high. Absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks
Recurrence rates in the groups were similar (RR 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.22; 2 studies, 101 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks and nonabsorbable tacks in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbablesutures
At six months there was one recurrence in each group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.79; 1 study, 36 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between nonabsorbable tacks and nonabsorbable sutures in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up and chronic pain is negligible. We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Absorbable tacks compared toabsorbable sutures
No recurrence was observed at one year (very low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain was higher in the tacks group (VAS 0 - 10: MD −2.70, 95% CI −6.67 to 1.27; 1 study, 48 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures in early postoperative pain because the certainty of evidence was very low. The MD for late follow-up pain was −0.30 (95% CI −0.74 to 0.14; 1 study, 48 participants). We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Combination of different fixation types (tacks and sutures) or materials (absorbable and nonabsorbable)
There were mostly negligible or only small differences between combinations (e.g. tacks plus sutures) compared to a single technique (e.g. sutures only), as well as combinations compared to other combinations (e.g. absorbable sutures combined with nonabsorbable sutures compared to absorbable tacks combined with nonabsorbable tacks) in all outcomes. It is uncertain whether there is an advantage for combining different fixation types or materials for recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications, because the evidence certainty was very low or low, or we found no study on important outcomes. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant
The two studies showed different directions of effects: one showed higher rates for nonabsorbable tacks, and the other showed higher rates for fibrin sealant. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Absorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant
One recurrence in the tacks group and none in the fibrin sealant group were noted after one year (low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain might be slightly lower using tacks (VAS 0 - 100; MD −12.40, 95% CI −27.60 to, 2.80;1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). The pattern of pain and HRQOL course over time (up to 1 year) was similar in the groups (low certainty of evidence). Currently none of the techniques can be considered superior to any other, because the certainty of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.","We included 10 studies involving 787 persons, with ages ranging from 31 to 62 years. Eight studies included people with primary as well as incisional ventral hernia, one study included people with umbilical (navel area) hernia only, and another study with incisional hernia only. Hernia size varied widely between studies. The number of included participants ranged from 40 to 199. Participant follow-up was mostly short (less than 12 months). The differences between the fixation techniques were small for our analysed outcomes. We could not find any difference between the use of tacks compared to sutures (stitches), the use of absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks, the use of absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures and the use of fibrin sealant compared to tacks. In addition, the combination of fixation techniques (sutures and tacks) or materials (absorbable and nonabsorbable) showed no advantage for recurrence, pain or other complications. The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes of recurrence and pain, as well as for complications, was very low or low. The main reason for this was a lack of sufficient data, due to the small number of included participants, and the small number of hernia recurrences. Furthermore, almost all studies were at moderate to high risk of bias, as the healthcare professionals involved were unblinded, i.e. aware of the interventions their patients received."
CD004405,"We included 25 studies involving 4121 participants (2511 children and 1517 adults; 93 mixed population). Four studies were of high quality with no risk of bias, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, indicating a moderate risk of bias for the total analysis. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries. There was insufficient evidence that corticosteroids caused a reduction in mortality overall (17.8% versus 19.9%; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.01; P = 0.07), or for adults (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.09). However they caused lower rates of severe hearing loss (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88), any hearing loss (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87) and neurological sequelae (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00). Subgroup analyses for causative organisms showed that corticosteroids reduced mortality in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) meningitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98), but not in Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) orNeisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) meningitis. Corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss in children with H influenzae meningitis (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.59) but not in children with meningitis due to non-Haemophilus species. In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.73), any hearing loss (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73) and short-term neurological sequelae (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.85). There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries. Subgroup analysis for study quality showed no effect of corticosteroids on severe hearing loss in high-quality studies. Corticosteroid treatment was associated with an increase in recurrent fever (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47), but not with other adverse events. Corticosteroids significantly reduced hearing loss and neurological sequelae, but did not reduce overall mortality. Data support the use of corticosteroids in patients with bacterial meningitis in high-income countries. We found no beneficial effect in low-income countries.","The evidence is current to February 2015. We identified 25 trials, including 4121 participants with acute bacterial meningitis of which seven were performed in adults (over 16 years old), two included both children and adults and the other were performed in children. In 22 studies the corticosteroid used was dexamethasone, in three others hydrocortisone or prednisone were used. Nine studies were performed in low-income countries and 16 in high-income countries. This review found that the corticosteroid dexamethasone did not significantly reduce the death rate (17.8% versus 19.9%). Patients treated with corticosteroids had significantly lower rates of severe hearing loss (6.0% versus 9.3%), any hearing loss (13.8% versus 19.0%) and neurological sequelae (17.9% versus 21.6%). An analysis for different bacteria causing meningitis showed that patients with meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) treated with corticosteroids had a lower death rate (29.9% versus 36.0%), while no effect on mortality was seen in patients with Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis) meningitis. In high-income countries, corticosteroids reduced severe hearing loss, any hearing loss and short-term neurological sequelae. There was no beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in low-income countries. Corticosteroids decreased the rate of hearing loss in children with meningitis due to H influenzae (4% versus 12%), but not in children with meningitis due to other bacteria. Dexamethasone increased the rate of recurrent fever (28% versus 22%) but was not associated with other adverse events. Out of 25 studies, four were of high quality, 14 of medium quality and seven of low quality, leading to a moderate overall quality of evidence."
CD010645,"We included four RCTs with 167 participants. Risk of bias of the included studies was high, as none of them reported method of randomization, allocation concealment or blinding. Only one trial mentioned our primary outcome of duration of anaesthesia. The mean difference in duration of anaesthesia with use of adrenaline with lidocaine was 3.20 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.48 to 3.92 hours; one RCT, 20 participants; low-quality evidence). No trial reported adverse events such as ischaemia distal to the injection site, and no trial reported cost analysis. One trial mentioned the secondary outcome of duration of postoperative pain relief, but available data were insufficient for analysis of the findings. Two trials reported the secondary outcome of reduced bleeding during surgery. Bleeding during surgery was observed in nine out of 52 participants as compared with 25 out of 51 participants in the adrenaline with lidocaine and plain lidocaine groups, respectively. The risk ratio for bleeding in the adrenaline with lidocaine group was 0.35 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; two RCTs, 103 participants; low-quality evidence). From the limited data available, evidence is insufficient to recommend use or avoidance of adrenaline in digital nerve blocks. The evidence provided in this review indicates that addition of adrenaline to lidocaine may prolong the duration of anaesthesia and reduce the risk of bleeding during surgery, although the quality of the evidence is low. We have identified the need for researchers to conduct large trials that focus on other important outcomes such as adverse events, cost analysis and duration of postoperative pain relief.","Evidence is current to November 2014. We included studies in children (aged older than 28 days and younger than 18 years) and adult patients (aged 18 years or older) of either gender undergoing surgery on digits (fingers and toes) under nerve blocks using adrenaline with lidocaine. We found four eligible studies with 167 participants. One small study reported the duration of anaesthesia and found that adrenaline prolonged the duration of anaesthesia, but the quality of the evidence was low. No study reported on adverse events such as ischaemia distal to the injection site or cost analysis with use of adrenaline with lidocaine. Duration of postoperative pain relief was reported by one study, but available data were insufficient for analysis of the findings. Two studies reported reduced bleeding during surgery with use of adrenaline with lidocaine. In the light of our results, we would expect that 17.2 out of 100 patients who received adrenaline with lidocaine (between 8.7 and 29.8 patients) would have bleeding during surgery compared with 49 patients who would have received plain lidocaine; however, the quality of the evidence was low, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in this estimate. The quality of evidence is low for both duration of anaesthesia and bleeding during surgery with use of adrenaline with lidocaine. Further research is needed to prove the benefits of adding adrenaline to lidocaine."
CD005010,"We included only one comparison of whole gland cryotherapy versus external beam radiotherapy, which was informed by two trials with a total of 307 randomised participants. The median age of the included studies was around 70 years. The median follow-up of included studies ranged from 100 to 105 months. Primary outcomes: we are uncertain about the effect of whole gland cryotherapy compared to radiation therapy on time to death from prostate cancer; hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 9.45; 2 trials, 293 participants; very low QoE); this would correspond to zero fewer death from prostate cancer per 1000 men (95% CI 85 fewer to 520 more). We are equally uncertain about the effect of quality of life-related urinary function and bowel function (QoL) at 36 months using the UCLA-Prostate Cancer Index score for which higher values (range: 0 to 100) reflect better quality of life using minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of 8 and 7 points, respectively; mean difference (MD) of 4.4 (95% CI −6.5 to 15.3) and 4.0 (95% CI −73.96 to 81.96), respectively (1 trial, 195 participants; very low QoE). We are also uncertain about sexual function-related QoL using a MCID of 8 points; MD of −20.7 (95% CI −36.29 to −5.11; 1 trial, 195 participants; very low QoE). Lastly, we are uncertain of the risk for major adverse events; risk ratio (RR): 0.91 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.78; 2 trials, 293 participants; very low QoE); this corresponds to 10 fewer major adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 58 fewer to 86 more). Secondary outcomes: we are very uncertain about the effects of cryotherapy on time to death from any cause (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.05 to 18.79; 2 trials, 293 participants; very low QoE), and time to biochemical failure (HR 2.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 62.12; 2 trials, 293 participants; very low QoE). Rates of secondary interventions for treatment failure and minor adverse events were either not reported in the trials, or the data could not be used for analyses. We found no trials that compared whole gland cryotherapy or focal cryotherapy to other treatment forms such as radical surgery, active surveillance, watchful waiting or other forms of radiotherapy. Based on very low quality evidence, primary whole gland cryotherapy has uncertain effects on oncologic outcomes, QoL, and major adverse events compared to external beam radiotherapy. Reasons for downgrading the QoE included serious study limitations, indirectness due to the use of lower doses of radiation in the comparison group than currently recommended, and serious or very serious imprecision.","We searched the medical literature for evidence from trials up to 6 March 2018. We found two randomised trials that compared freezing of the whole prostate to radiation treatment. These included 307 randomised men with prostate cancer (cryotherapy 154 men, radiation 153 men). Their average age was around 70 years. These studies followed men for eight to nine years after treatment. We did not find any studies that compared freezing the prostate to surgery. Also, we did not find randomised trials that compared freezing of parts of the prostate (focal cryotherapy) to radiation, surgery or no treatment. We are uncertain of the effects of freezing of the whole prostate compared to radiation treatment on the time to death from prostate cancer, quality of life for urinary, bowel, and sexual function and serious unwanted treatment reactions. The quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes meaning that the real effect of whole gland cryotherapy may differ a lot from the findings in this review. Further research is very likely to change these findings."
CD007954,"There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6-8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo. For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43.. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively) . The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs. Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care.","However, most systematic reviews of antidepressant treatment have included trials conducted in secondary care settings. There has been doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care, and hence the impetus to do this review. Through extensive searches of the literature we found 14 studies conducted in adults (not the elderly) in primary care setting, in which tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were compared against a placebo control group in the treatment of depression. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were effective for depression. Most of the studies were supported by funds from pharmaceutical companies and were of short duration. There appeared to be more adverse effects with TCAs than with SSRIs, however rates of withdrawal from study medication due to adverse effects were very similar between the two antidepressant classes. Adverse effects not leading to medication cessation seemed to be more common with TCAs than SSRIs."
CD011828,"We identified eight trials published from 2004 to 2017 randomising a total of 1730 participants, with mean intervention duration of 12 weeks. All eight trials were judged to be at overall high risk of bias and effect estimates are reported at the end of the intervention with a follow-up range of eight to 24 weeks. Seven trials reported all-cause mortality, but deaths only occurred in one trial with no evidence of a difference between exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and control (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 21.26; participants = 196; trials = 1; quality of evidence: low). There was also no evidence of a difference in serious adverse events between exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and control (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44; participants = 356; trials = 2; quality of evidence: low). Due to the variation in reporting of health-related quality of life outcomes, it was not possible to pool data. However, the five trials reporting health-related quality of life at the end of the intervention, each showed little or no evidence of a difference between exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and control. For secondary outcomes, there was evidence of a higher pooled exercise capacity (peak VO2) at the end of the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.91 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.21; participants = 1485; trials = 7; quality of evidence: very low) favouring exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, albeit there was evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 78%). There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of requiring antitachycardia pacing (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.90; participants = 356; trials = 2; quality of evidence: moderate), appropriate shock (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.58; participants = 428; studies = 3; quality of evidence: low) or inappropriate shock (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.51; participants = 160; studies = 1; quality of evidence: moderate). Due to a lack of evidence, we were unable to definitively assess the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events and health-related quality of life in adults with an ICD. However, our findings do provide very low-quality evidence that patients following exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation experience a higher exercise capacity compared with the no exercise control. Further high-quality randomised trials are needed in order to assess the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in this population on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, antitachycardia pacing and shock.","We searched for randomised controlled trials (experiments in which participants are randomly allocated to an experimental intervention compared with a control intervention) that investigated exercise-based interventions compared with no exercise intervention control. We found eight trials published from 2004 to 2017 with a total of 1730 participants. Two trials did not report on funding and one trial reported funding from industry. The evidence is current to 30 August 2018. The review showed no evidence of an impact on the risk of death, harmful side effects or having antitachycardia pacing or shock therapy when comparing the exercise intervention to the control. There was also little or no evidence of a difference on health-related quality of life. However, there was an improvement in exercise capacity in favour of the exercise group. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low for all outcomes. The number of events was low, it was possible for people in the trials to know to which intervention group they were randomised, the reporting of the results was not complete in some trials, and for some outcomes, the results varied across trials. These considerations limited our confidence in the overall results of the review. Further adequately powered and well-conducted randomised trials are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator."
CD013601,"We included 52 studies (47 parallel RCTs and five cross-over RCTs) (3398 randomised participants). All studies compared L-carnitine with a placebo, other treatment, or no treatment. Standard care was continued as co-interventions in each group. Most studies were judged to have an unclear or high risk of bias. L-carnitine may have little or no effect on the quality of life (QoL) SF-36 physical component score (PCS) (4 studies, 134 participants: SMD 0.57, 95% CI -0.15 to 1.28; I² = 73%; low certainty of evidence), and the total QoL score (Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL), VAS (general well-being), or PedsQL) (3 studies, 230 participants: SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.25; I² = 0%; low certainty of evidence). L-carnitine may improve SF-36 mental component score (MCS) (4 studies, 134 participants: SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.18; I² = 42%; low certainty of evidence). L-carnitine may have little or no effect on fatigue score (2 studies, 353 participants: SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.23; I² = 0%; low certainty of evidence), adverse events (12 studies, 1041 participants: RR, 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.51; I² = 0%; low certainty of evidence), muscle cramps (2 studies, 102 participants: RR, 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.09; I² = 23%; low certainty of evidence), and intradialytic hypotension (3 studies, 128 participants: RR, 0.76, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.69; I² = 0%; low certainty of evidence). L-carnitine may improve haemoglobin levels (26 studies, 1795 participants: MD 0.46 g/dL, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74; I² = 86%; low certainty of evidence) and haematocrit values (14 studies, 950 participants: MD 1.78%, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.18; I² = 84%; low certainty of evidence). The available evidence does not currently support the use of carnitine supplementation in the treatment of dialysis-related carnitine deficiency. Although carnitine supplementation may slightly improve anaemia-related markers, carnitine supplementation makes little or no difference to adverse events. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution.","We identified 52 studies with a total of 3398 CKD patients undergoing dialysis. We could not determine the impact of L-carnitine on quality of life (QoL) and symptoms due to dialysis-related carnitine deficiency. L-carnitine may improve anaemia in these patients. Additionally, evidence for the adverse effects of L-carnitine supplementation in this patient population is very limited. We found that the effects of carnitine supplementation with respect to QoL, fatigue score, muscle cramps, and intradialytic hypotension remain unclear. L-carnitine may improve anaemia-related markers (haemoglobin level and haematocrit values) in CKD patients requiring dialysis. More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of carnitine supplements in this patient population."
CD003982,"The five trials that met our criteria included 698 patients: data from 499 (71.5%) were available for analysis of relapse frequency at one year's, from 488 (70%) at two years' and from 415 (59.5%) at three years' follow-up. Azathioprine reduced the number of patients who had relapses during the first year of treatment (relative risk reduction [RRR] =20%; 95% CI = 5% to 33%), at two years' (RRR =23%; 95% CI = 12% to 33%) and three years' (RRR =18%; 95% CI = 7% to 27%) follow-up. These results were consistent in sensitivity analysis. There was no heterogeneity among the studies. Data from only three small trials with a total of 87 patients were available to calculate the number of patients who progressed during the first two to three years. There was a statistically significant benefit (RRR = 42%; 95% CI = 7% to 64%) of azathioprine therapy at three years' follow-up; this result was robust after sensitivity analyses and there was no heterogeneity among the trials. Gastrointestinal disturbances, bone marrow suppression and hepatic toxicity were greater in the azathioprine group rather than in the placebo group; they were anticipated, and, by monitoring and dosage adjustment, were easily managed. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were few, occurring mostly during the first year of azathioprine treatment and mainly due to gastrointestinal intolerance (5%). Data from the trials and from cohort and case controls studies available in the literature did not show an increase in risk of malignancy from azathioprine. A possible long-term risk of cancer from azathioprine may be related to a treatment duration above ten years and cumulative doses above 600 g. Azathioprine is an appropriate maintenance treatment for patients with MS who frequently relapse and require steroids. Cumulative doses of 600 g should not be exceeded in relation to a possible increased risk of malignancy. Considering the trade off between the benefits and harms, azathioprine is a fair alternative to interferon beta for treating MS. A logical next step for future trials would seem the direct comparison of azathioprine and interferon beta. In fact the direct comparison between these two widely used treatments in MS has not been made.","Two studies had deaths reported, comprising of four persons in the control group, and eight in the AZA group. These small numbers do not allow a statistical analysis. Conflicting conclusions on potential risk of cancer in MS patients with long-term AZA treatment have been reported in eight published papers, not considered in the present review because they came from sources other than clinical trials. The presence of patients who developed cancer ( three in the AZA and 1 the placebo group) was reported in two out of five studies considered in this review. Numerous studies of AZA treated patient populations other than MS patients are also available. The whole data, however, does not show an increase in risk of malignancy from AZA. Possible long-term risks may be related to a treatment duration above ten years and cumulative doses above 600 g."
CD003486,"Only four small randomised controlled trials fulfilled the selection criteria. For one of these trials, no data are available for the control group. Two studies compared lavage using diluted surfactant with standard care. Meta-analysis of these two studies did not show a significant effect on mortality (typical relative risk 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 1.46; typical risk difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.04) or the use of ECMO (typical relative risk 0.27, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.86; typical risk difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.04). For the composite outcome of death or use of ECMO, a significant effect favoured the lavage group (typical relative risk 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.96; typical risk difference -0.19, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03; number needed to benefit [NNTB] 5). No other benefits were reported. The other published study compared surfactant lavage followed by a surfactant bolus with surfactant bolus therapy alone in MAS complicated by pulmonary hypertension. No significant improvements in mortality, pneumothorax, duration of mechanical ventilation. or duration of hospitalisation were observed. In infants with meconium aspiration syndrome, lung lavage with diluted surfactant may be beneficial, but additional controlled clinical trials of lavage therapy should be conducted to confirm the treatment effect, to refine the method of lavage treatment, and to compare lavage treatment with other approaches, including surfactant bolus therapy. Long-term outcomes should be evaluated in further clinical trials.","This review examined whether cleansing the lung using a natural chemical called surfactant, or another similar fluid, is helpful in MAS. This cleansing procedure is known as lung lavage. Lung lavage with diluted surfactant may help improve the clinical course of infants with MAS, in particular, the likelihood of survival without the need for heart-lung bypass. More trials will be needed to properly evaluate lavage treatment in MAS."
CD006153,"Five RCTs involving 895 sporadic and 52 familial ALS/MND participants were included. There was no statistical evidence for a differential response to treatment in participants with familial ALS/MND compared to those with sporadic ALS/MND. The pooled estimate of the hazard ratio for the interaction term (treatment x familial ALS) suggested a more beneficial response with respect to survival among participants with familial ALS/MND, but the result was not statistically significant. Pooled estimates of the rate of decline on the ALSFRS suggested a slightly better overall response to treatment among those with familial ALS/MND, but the result was not statistically significant. Based on the available data, there is little evidence for a differential response to treatment among people with familial and sporadic ALS/MND. Future randomized controlled trials should document whether people with familial ALS/MND are included and the presence or absence of a mutation in an ALS susceptibility gene amongst those with familial ALS/MND.","We identified all randomized controlled trials in ALS/MND and wrote to the authors to request the data needed to complete this review. Although many more studies were eligible for inclusion, only five authors were willing and able to share the data from their individual randomized controlled trials. Based on the analyses of these data, we find no evidence to support a statistically significant difference in the response to treatment between people with the familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND."
CD005009,"Five randomized studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL) between IAS and CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. For patients with a Gleason score > 6, reduction in biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.02). Studies primarily reported on adverse events. One trial (N = 43) found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia) between IAS ( two events) and CAS (five events), with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in the IAS group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, P = 0.008). Data from RCTs comparing IAS to CAS are limited by small sample size and short duration. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).","Five studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review.

CD006803,"Overall, 17 trials with 736 patients met the inclusion criteria for this review. All trials had high risk of bias. Five hundred and one patients randomised in 11 trials provided information for various comparisons in this systematic review after excluding post-randomisation drop-outs and patients from trials that did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The comparisons for which outcomes were available included pegylated (peg) interferon versus control; peg interferon plus ribavirin versus control; ribavirin plus peg interferon versus peg interferon; peg interferon (1.5 μg/kg/week) plus ribavirin versus peg interferon (0.5 μg/kg/week) plus ribavirin; amantadine plus peg interferon plus ribavirin versus peg interferon plus ribavirin; interferon versus control; interferon plus ribavirin versus control; ribavirin versus interferon; and ribavirin versus placebo. Long-term follow-up was not available in these trials. There were no significant differences in mortality, retransplantation, graft rejections requiring retransplantation or medical treatment, or fibrosis worsening between the groups in any of the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported. Quality of life and liver decompensation were not reported in any of the trials. There was a significantly higher proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events in the ribavirin plus peg interferon combination therapy group than in the peg interferon monotherapy group (1 trial; 56 participants; 17/28 (60.7%) in the intervention group versus 5/28 (17.9%) in the control group; RR 3.40; 95% CI 1.46 to 7.94). There was no significant difference in proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events or in the number of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups in the other comparisons that reported serious adverse events. Considering the lack of clinical benefit, there is currently no evidence to recommend or refute antiviral treatment for recurrent liver graft infection with hepatitis C virus. Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and low risk of random errors with adequate duration of follow-up are necessary.","Eleven trials including 501 liver transplant recipients provided data for this review. The patients were randomised to receive different treatments including no treatment in these 11 trials. Long-term follow-up was not available in these trials. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who died, required retransplantation, developed graft rejection that required treatment, or increased liver damage (as evaluated using a microscope) between the groups in any of the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported. Quality of life and liver decompensation were not reported in any of the trials. There was a significantly higher proportion of participants who developed serious complications in the ribavirin plus peg interferon combination therapy compared with peg interferon monotherapy. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications or in the number of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups in the other comparisons that reported serious complications. There is currently no evidence to recommend antiviral treatment for patients with recurrence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection either in primary liver transplantation or retransplantation. All the trials had high risk of systematic errors (that is, bias where was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trials were conducted overestimating benefits and underestimating harms) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance). The overall quality of evidence was very low. Further randomised clinical trials at low risk of random errors or systematic errors are necessary to assess the long-term survival and other benefits of various treatment options in these patients."
CD009209,"We included 14 studies, recruiting a total of 4762 participants. These studies were conducted in various high-income countries and in diverse workplaces (from offices to physical workplaces). Participants included both healthy populations and those at risk of chronic disease (e.g. through inactivity or overweight), with a mean age of 41 years. All studies used multi-component health promotion interventions. Eleven studies used minimal intervention controls, and four used alternative physical activity interventions. Intervention duration ranged from one week to two years, and follow-up after completion of the intervention ranged from three to ten months. Most studies and outcomes were rated at overall unclear or high risk of bias, and only one study was rated at low risk of bias. The most frequent concerns were absence of blinding and high rates of attrition. When pedometer interventions are compared to minimal interventions at follow-up points at least one month after completion of the intervention, pedometers may have no effect on physical activity (6 studies; very low-certainty evidence; no meta-analysis due to very high heterogeneity), but the effect is very uncertain. Pedometers may have effects on sedentary behaviour and on quality of life (mental health component), but these effects were very uncertain (1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Pedometer interventions may slightly reduce anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) -0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.45 to 0.18; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). Pedometer interventions probably had little to no effect on blood pressure (systolic: -0.08 mmHg, 95% CI -3.26 to 3.11; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and may have reduced adverse effects (such as injuries; from 24 to 10 per 100 people in populations experiencing relatively frequent events; odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84; low-certainty evidence). No studies compared biochemical measures or disease risk scores at follow-up after completion of the intervention versus a minimal intervention. Comparison of pedometer interventions to alternative physical activity interventions at follow-up points at least one month after completion of the intervention revealed that pedometers may have an effect on physical activity, but the effect is very uncertain (1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Sedentary behaviour, anthropometry (BMI or waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic or diastolic), biochemistry (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides), disease risk scores, quality of life (mental or physical health components), and adverse effects at follow-up after completion of the intervention were not compared to an alternative physical activity intervention. Some positive effects were observed immediately at completion of the intervention periods, but these effects were not consistent, and overall certainty of evidence was insufficient to assess the effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions. Exercise interventions can have positive effects on employee physical activity and health, although current evidence is insufficient to suggest that a pedometer-based intervention would be more effective than other options. It is important to note that over the past decade, technological advancement in accelerometers as commercial products, often freely available in Smartphones, has in many ways rendered the use of pedometers outdated. Future studies aiming to test the impact of either pedometers or accelerometers would likely find any control arm highly contaminated. Decision-makers considering allocating resources to large-scale programmes of this kind should be cautious about the expected benefits of incorporating a pedometer and should note that these effects may not be sustained over the longer term. Future studies should be designed to identify the effective components of multi-component interventions, although pedometers may not be given the highest priority (especially considering the increased availability of accelerometers). Approaches to increase the sustainability of intervention effects and behaviours over a longer term should be considered, as should more consistent measures of physical activity and health outcomes.","We found 14 studies including 4762 people in different workplaces, ranging from offices to construction sites, mostly in high-income countries. In all studies, pedometers were part of a health programme that included other components, such as walking groups, counselling, or dietary advice. Studies compared the effects of participating in pedometer programmes with:
- receiving no or a minimal health programme such as regular advice about the benefits of physical activity; and
- participating in other health programmes, that did not include a pedometer. The programmes lasted from two weeks to two years; assessments continued for three to ten months afterwards. We were most interested to see whether there pedometers had a lasting effect on physical activity and health. We were also interested in learning about effects on sedentary behaviour (time spent sitting), risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and levels of cholesterol in the blood), quality of life (well-being) and adverse (unwanted) effects. 
Pedometer programmes may not affect physical activity at least one month after the programme end (6 studies), but they may reduce sedentary behaviour and may improve people's well-being (1 study). We have very little certainty about these results. Pedometer programmes may slightly reduce body mass index (3 studies, low certainty), but probably make little to no difference in blood pressure (2 studies, moderate certainty) and may reduce unwanted effects such as injuries (2 studies, low certainty). No studies measured cholesterol or disease risk scores at least one month after the programme ended. Compared with another health programme:
Pedometer programmes may affect physical activity after at least one month since the programme end (1 study), but we have very little certainty about this result. We could not draw conclusions about unwanted effects. The evidence was not good enough for us to be certain about effects on sedentary behaviour, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, cardiovascular disease risk and well-being. Some effects were seen but findings were not consistent. Exercise programmes can have positive effects on an employee's physical activity and health, but we did not find enough reliable evidence to be certain whether a pedometer programme is better than other types of health programmes, especially for achieving long-term changes in behaviour. Evidence is uncertain because results were reported by a small number of studies — sometimes only one study. In most studies, the people involved knew which study group they were in, which can affect results. Many people dropped out of studies before the studies ended, so not enough results were collected. Some studies did not report any results for some measures we were interested in or did not assess/evaluate if benefits were maintained after the program ended. As pedometers are largely being replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps, we will not update this review again."
CD001954,"We included 16 trials involving 2648 participants. We were able to analyse 15 of the trials with 2496 participants. The pooled analysis of all the trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about days 10 to 14 between the two groups (risk ratio (RR), random-effects 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85). A subgroup analysis in trials with acute bronchitis participants showed significantly lower clinical failure in the azithromycin group compared to amoxycillin or amoxyclav (RR random-effects 0.63; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). A sensitivity analysis showed a non-significant reduction in clinical failure in azithromycin-treated participants (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.49 in 12 studies with inadequate concealment. Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00). There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI. In patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower incidence of treatment failure and adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, most studies were of unclear methodological quality and had small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed.","Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of an acute LRTI, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. We analysed the results from 15 trials with 2496 participants. The effects of azithromycin on cure, improvement or failure were not better than those of amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, azithromycin seems to have a lower incidence of adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav but it is not significant. Overall the quality of the evidence for the main outcome is low as only three of 15 included trials showed adequate allocation concealment. Hence, currently, there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI."
CD001535,"Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study. Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.","We identified 15 studies (1644 elderly women) comparing single dose, short-course (3 to 6 days) and long course (7 to 14 days) antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic UTI in elderly women. Our review suggests that single dose treatments are less effective than short or long courses, but better accepted by the patients. On the other hand longer courses may have more side effects. On the basis of the evidence available at present, an antibiotic treatment of 3 to 6 days could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific, commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed."
CD005595,"Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1896 participants were included. Only one study was judged at low risk of bias. Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at high risk of selective reporting bias. Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast. One study (12 participants) found 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes. Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone. Using a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise significantly reduced activity limitation in five of the eight studies reporting this outcome, reduced pain (number of participants with pain at the long term follow-up: 10/35 versus 25/34; risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.68; 2 studies) and improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events (49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; 7 studies). During the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, commencing weight-bearing made a small improvement in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (mean difference in the difference in range of motion compared with the non-fractured side at the long term follow-up 6.17%, 95% CI 0.14 to 12.20; 2 studies). Evidence from one small but potentially biased study (60 participants) showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short-term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. One study found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with cast immobilisation, but another showed using a backslab improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared with using a bandage. Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. There was no evidence of effect for stretching or manual therapy in addition to exercise, or exercise compared with usual care. One small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy. There is limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight-bearing and the use of a removable type of immobilisation to allow exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. Because of the potential increased risk of adverse events, the patient's ability to comply with the use of a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise is essential. There is little evidence for rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management and no evidence for stretching, manual therapy or exercise compared to usual care following the immobilisation period. Small, single studies showed that some electrotherapy modalities may be beneficial. More clinical trials that are well-designed and adequately-powered are required to strengthen current evidence.","Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1,896 participants were included in the review. Many of the trials were potentially biased. Three studies examined rehabilitation interventions that started during the immobilisation period after non-surgical treatment. There is some very limited evidence of short term benefit of one type of brace compared with immobilisation with a cast or orthosis. There was no evidence for hypnosis. Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions that started during the immobilisation period after surgical treatment. Ten of these compared the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise with cast immobilisation alone. There is some evidence from these that using a removable brace or splint so that gentle ankle exercises can be performed during the immobilisation period may enhance the return to normal activities, reduce pain and improve ankle movement. However, the incidence of adverse events (such as problems with the surgical wound) may also be increased. Starting walking early may also slightly improve ankle movement. One small and biased study showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short-term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions that started after the immobilisation period. There is no evidence of improved function for stretching or manual therapy when either of these are added to an exercise programme, or for an exercise programme when this is compared with usual care. One small and potentially biased study found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy."
CD006833,"We found three studies for inclusion in the review. One recruited males with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy and had elected to receive external-beam radiation therapy; the second study recruited community-living participants who were aged 55 years and older; the third study recruited university students. These studies included subgroups with anxiety and depression as defined by symptom scores and provided data separately for those subgroups. As this included only 25 people with anxiety and 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression, but which was not specified, the results could only be reported narratively. They show no evidence that Reiki is either beneficial or harmful in this population. The risk of bias for the included studies was generally rated as unclear or high for most domains, which reduces the certainty of the evidence. There is insufficient evidence to say whether or not Reiki is useful for people over 16 years of age with anxiety or depression or both.","We found three studies for inclusion in the review.

This included only 25 people with anxiety, 17 with depression and 20 more with either anxiety or depression but which was not specified. The search is up to date as of 4 November 2014. Very few people with anxiety or depression or both have been included in randomised studies. This means there is insufficient evidence to make any comment about the usefulness of Reiki for the treatment of anxiety and depression. At best, the quality of the evidence is moderate which, on top of a dearth of evidence, weakens the findings further."
CD007378,"Five randomised trials were identified with a total of 207 participants, 102 to colorectal stenting and 105 to emergency surgery. There was statistically significant higher clinical success rate in the emergency surgery group. The average time of clinical relief of obstruction was 0.66 day in the colonic stent group and was 3.55 days in the emergency surgery group. The stent insertion was successful in 86.02% of attempted stent placements. There was no statistically significant difference in the 30-day mortality between two groups. The 30 day mortality rate was similar, 2.3% in both groups. The stent related perforation rate was 5.88%. The stent migration rate was 2.13%. The stent obstruction rate was 2.13%. There was no statistically significant difference in overall complication rate in both groups. The complication rate was 39.22% in the colonic stent group and was 45.71% in the emergency surgery group. The mean hospital stay was 11.53 days in the colonic stent group and was 17.15 days in the emergency surgery group. The mean procedure/operating time was 113.93 minutes in the colonic stent group compared to 143.85 minutes in the emergency surgery group. The median blood loss was 50 ml in the colonic stent group and 350 ml in the emergency surgery group. The use of colonic stent in malignant colorectal obstruction seems to have no advantage over emergency surgery. The clinical success rate was statistically higher in emergency surgery group. However, use of colorectal stents seems to be as safe in the malignant colorectal obstruction as the emergency surgery with no statistically significant difference in the mortality and morbidity. Colorectal stents are associated with acceptable stent perforation, migration and obstruction rates. The advantages of colorectal stent includes shorter hospital stay and procedure time and less blood loss. However, due to the variability in the sample size and trial designs in the included studies, further randomised trials with bigger sample size and well defined trial design are needed to achieve the robust evidence.","This systematic review of five randomised trial shows higher rates of clinical relief of obstruction in emergency surgery. Colonic stent has not been shown to be as effective as emergency surgery in malignant colorectal obstructions. However, use of colonic stent is associated with comparable mortality and morbidity with advantage of shorter hospital stay and procedure time and less blood loss. Further randomised controlled trials with larger sample size and robust trial design are required on this topic."
CD007366,"We included four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women in the review. The four included trials evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine postpartum care to both treatment and control groups. Pooled data existed only for the comparison of lanolin versus usual care. We did not pool data for other outcomes due to either heterogeneity in outcome measures or differing interventions. There was no evidence that glycerine gel dressings or breast shells with lanolin significantly improved nipple pain. One trial found no clear differences in nipple pain (at one to three days, four to five days, or six to seven days' post-treatment) between women who applied lanolin or nothing to their nipples. In contrast, the same trial found that women who applied expressed breast milk had significantly lower perceptions of nipple pain following four to five days of treatment than women who applied lanolin. However, this beneficial effect was not maintained after six to seven days of treatment. There were no group differences in nipple pain perceptions at any assessment between women who applied expressed breast milk and women who applied nothing. Women who applied an ""all-purpose nipple ointment"", in comparison to women who applied lanolin, had no improvement in nipple pain after seven days of treatment. There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, or all-purpose nipple ointment improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any intervention for the treatment of nipple pain. However, one important finding was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women nipple pain reduced to mild levels after approximately seven to 10 days' postpartum. The provision of anticipatory guidance regarding usual time to pain reduction may be a useful strategy in assisting women to continue to breastfeed and to do so exclusively. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain as assessed using GRADE was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis. There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, breast shells with lanolin, lanolin alone, or the all-purpose nipple ointment significantly improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. The results from these four trials of good methodological quality suggested that applying nothing or just expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin. The quality of the evidence for this review did not lead to robust conclusions regarding the objectives assessed. We included only four trials, incorporating 656 women, in the review and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, study outcome measures, and standards of usual care. The methodological quality of the included studies was good but the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.","We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials database for clinical trials assessing methods (interventions) of improving nipple pain among breastfeeding women in September 2014. We also looked at healing and infection of nipples, length of breastfeeding, if infants only received breast milk, and if mothers were happy with treatment for nipple problems and breastfeeding in general. Interventions included drug treatments (against bacteria given by mouth, spray, ointment; against fungal infections), non-drug treatments (lanolin, petroleum jelly, peppermint oil, glycerine), dressings, nipple protectors (breast shields or shells), light treatment, or applying expressed breast milk. Interventions were compared with each other or usual care (control). We found four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women, which evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine care to both intervention and control groups. Currently, there is not enough evidence to recommend any specific type of treatment for painful nipples among breastfeeding women. These results suggest that applying nothing or expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin. One important finding in this review was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women, nipple pain reduced to mild levels approximately seven to 10 days' after giving birth (postpartum). The quality of the evidence for this review did not allow robust conclusions regarding treating nipple pain. We found only four small trials and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, what was measured, and standards of usual care. While the methodological quality of the included studies was good, the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly due to single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis."
CD003992,"Twenty-two trials (3142 episodes in 2372 patients) were included in the analyses. The mortality rate was similar when comparing oral to intravenous antibiotic treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.68, 9 trials, 1392 patients, median mortality 0, range 0% to 8.8%). Treatment failure rates were also similar (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, all trials). No significant heterogeneity was shown for all comparisons but adverse events. The effect was stable in a wide range of patients. Quinolones alone or combined with another antibiotic were used with comparable results. Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, were more common with oral antibiotics. Based on the present data, oral treatment is an acceptable alternative to intravenous antibiotic treatment in febrile neutropenic cancer patients (excluding patients with acute leukaemia) who are haemodynamically stable, without organ failure, and do not have pneumonia, infection of a central line or a severe soft-tissue infection. The wide CI for mortality allows the present use of oral treatment in groups of patients with an expected low risk for mortality, and further research should be aimed at clarifying the definition of low risk patients.","This review of randomised controlled trials showed comparable death and failure rates for oral and intravenous antibiotics for low risk patients, those with solid tumours or chronic leukaemia or lymphoma, and independent of age, source of infection and severity of the neutropenia."
CD007368,"We included four trials in which 3267 children aged two to 35 months participated. Analysis showed that zinc supplementation in addition to standard antibiotic therapy in children with severe and non-severe pneumonia failed to show a statistically significant effect on time-to-clinical recovery (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.11). Similary, zinc supplementation in children with severe pneumonia, as an adjunct to standard antibiotic therapy, did not show a statistically significant effect on time-to-recovery from tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 50 breaths per minute) (hazard ratio 1.13; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.57) and time-to-recovery from chest in-drawing (hazard ratio 1.08; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.31) as compared to the control group. Zinc supplementation in children with severe pneumonia also showed a non-significant effect on time-to-hospital discharge as compared to the control (hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.22).

CD006278,"This review includes only one RCT, funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship. This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause, and compared two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). Children were allocated randomly to one of the two treatments. Treatments were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia. Speech pathology students delivered the treatments in the English language. Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy. Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only. A number of cases in each cohort had recommenced usual treatment by their speech and language pathologist between one month and four months post-treatment (NDP-3: 9/13 participants; ReST: 9/13 participants). Hence, maintenance of treatment effects to four months post-treatment could not be analysed without significant potential bias, and thus this time point was not included for further analysis in this review. We judged all core outcome domains to be low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified. Both the NDP-3 and ReST therapies demonstrated improvement at one month post-treatment. For three outcomes the effect was marginally greater for NDP-3 than ReST: accuracy of production on treated words (NDP-3 mean difference (MD) = 36.0, ReST MD = 33.9; absolute MD = 2.1 between groups); speech production consistency, measured by 25 real words repeated three times using the inconsistency subtest of the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) test (NDP-3 MD = 11.1, ReST MD = 10.9; absolute MD = 0.2 between groups); and accuracy of connected speech, assessed by imitated word accuracy in connected speech of at least three word combinations (NDP-3 MD = 14.3, ReST MD = 11.5; absolute MD = 2.8 between groups). ReST (MD = 18.3) demonstrated a marginally greater effect than NDP-3 (MD = 18.2) for accuracy of production on non-treated words at one month post-treatment (absolute MD = 0.1 between groups). The study did not assess the outcome of functional communication. There is limited evidence that, when delivered intensively, both NDP-3 and ReST may effect improvement in word accuracy in 4- to 12-year-old children with CAS, measured by the accuracy of production on treated and non-treated words, speech production consistency and the accuracy of connected speech. The study did not measure functional communication. No formal analyses were conducted to compare NDP-3 and ReST by the original study authors, hence one treatment cannot be reliably advocated over the other. We are also unable to say whether either treatment is better than no treatment or treatment as usual. No evidence currently exists to support the effectiveness of other treatments for children aged 4 to 12 years with idiopathic CAS without other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders. Further RCTs replicating this study would strengthen the evidence base. Similarly, further RCTs are needed of other interventions, in other age ranges and populations with CAS and with co-occurring disorders.","We found one study with 26 children aged 4 to 12 years with CAS. The children had mild to severe CAS without a known cause. Children were allocated randomly (using a method like coin tossing) to one of two treatments: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme - Third Edition (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transition treatment (ReST). Both therapies were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks. The treatments were delivered by speech pathology students in a university clinic. Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy. Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only. The included study was funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas & Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship. Further studies replicating these findings would strengthen available evidence. The study provides limited evidence that the NDP-3 may improve the accuracy of production on treated items and the accuracy of connected speech. There is limited evidence that the NDP-3 has a negligible effect on speech production consistency, and the ReST a negligible effect on accuracy of production on non-treated words. The study did not measure functional communication. The included study was a randomised controlled trial with an overall low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate, due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified. There is limited evidence that the NDP-3 or ReST may be helpful for children with CAS of unknown origin, aged 4 to 12 years, without other co-occurring conditions. We were not able to find out whether one of these treatment was better than the other, or whether either was better than no treatment or treatment as usual. There is currently no available evidence for other treatments. Further RCTs — including studies comparing treatments to a no-treatment (wait-list) control group — would strengthen the evidence base. Further research is also needed for children with CAS and other disorders or diagnoses."
CD009905,"Fifty-eight community coalition-driven intervention studies were included. No study was considered to be at low risk of bias. Behavioral change outcomes and health status change outcomes were analyzed separately. Outcomes are grouped by intervention type. Pooled effects across intervention types are not presented because the diverse community coalition-led intervention studies did not examine the same constructs or relationships, and they used dissimilar methodological designs. Broad-scale community system level change strategies led to little or no difference in measures of health behavior or health status (very low-certainty evidence). Broad health and social care system level strategies leds to small beneficial changes in measures of health behavior or health status in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions led to beneficial changes in health behavior measures of moderate magnitude in large samples of community residents (very low-certainty evidence). Lay community health outreach worker interventions may lead to beneficial changes in health status measures in large samples of community residents; however, results were not consistent across studies (low-certainty evidence). Group-based health education led by professional staff resulted in moderate improvement in measures of health behavior (very low-certainty evidence) or health status (low-certainty evidence). Adverse outcomes of community coalition-led interventions were not reported. Coalition-led interventions are characterized by connection of multi-sectoral networks of health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities. These interventions benefit a diverse range of individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as health and social care delivery systems. Evidence in this review shows that interventions led by community coalitions may connect health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities in ways that benefit individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as care delivery systems. However, because information on characteristics of the coalitions themselves is insufficient, evidence does not provide an explanation for the underlying mechanisms of beneficial effects. Thus, a definitive answer as to whether a coalition-led intervention adds extra value to the types of community engagement intervention strategies described in this review remains unattainable.","This review, which included searches of databases from January 1990 through March 31, 2014, found 58 community coalition-driven studies, which addressed a wide array of health outcomes and risk behaviors. Only studies of community coalitions with at least one racial or ethnic minority group representing the target population and at least two community-based public or private organizations were included. This review examined the effects of four types of strategies or interventions used by community coalitions. Community system-level change strategies (such as initiatives targeting physical environments like housing, green spaces, neighborhood safety, or regulatory processes and policies) have produced small inconsistent effects; broad health and social care system-level strategies (such as programs targeting behavior of staff in a health or social care system, accessibility of services, or policies, procedures, and technologies designed to improve quality of care) have had consistently positive small effects; interventions that used lay community health outreach workers or group-based health education led by professional staff have produced fairly consistent positive effects; and group-based health education led by peers has had inconsistent effects. This review shows that interventions led by community coalitions may connect health and human service providers with ethnic and racial minority communities in ways that benefit individual health outcomes and behaviors, as well as care delivery systems. However, to achieve the same levels of health across communities, regardless of race or ethnicity, we need to know specifically how a program does or does not work. This will require better information on how some programs described in this review brought about beneficial change and theresources needed, so they can be replicated. Furthermore, we need better scientific tools to improve our ability to identify effects of programs on whole community systems and to understand the leverage points that, when employed appropriately, shift the distribution of health toward equity."
CD003458,"We identified 31 studies, and 13 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. We described trials that were not eligible for the review in the Discussion. The included studies involved a total of 85 participants, but the number in each individual trial was small; the largest treatment trial included 19 participants and the smallest study included only one participant. There was no benefit with: D-ribose, glucagon, verapamil, vitamin B6, branched chain amino acids, dantrolene sodium, and high-dose creatine. Minimal subjective benefit was found with low dose creatine and ramipril only for patients with a polymorphism known as the D/D angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) phenotype. A carbohydrate-rich diet resulted in better exercise performance compared with a protein-rich diet. Two studies of oral sucrose given at different times and in different amounts before exercise showed an improvement in exercise performance. Four studies reported adverse effects. Oral ribose caused diarrhoea and symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia including light-headedness and hunger. In one study, branched chain amino acids caused a deterioration of functional outcomes. Dantrolene was reported to cause a number of adverse effects including tiredness, somnolence, dizziness and muscle weakness. Low dose creatine (60 mg/kg/day) did not cause side-effects but high-dose creatine (150 mg/kg/day) worsened the symptoms of myalgia. Although there was low quality evidence of improvement in some parameters with creatine, oral sucrose, ramipril and a carbohydrate-rich diet, none was sufficiently strong to indicate significant clinical benefit.","After a wide search, we identified 13 randomised studies that included 85 participants with McArdle disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2004. We found no new trials at this update. The review found no benefit compared with placebo with the following treatments: D-ribose, glucagon, verapamil, vitamin B6, oral branched chain amino acids, dantrolene sodium, high-dose creatine and ramipril. Low dose creatine and ramipril produced minimal benefit for patients who also have the D/D angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) phenotype. Taking low dose creatine supplements had a minor benefit in improving exercise tolerance in a small number of people with the condition. Taking a sugary drink before planned strenuous exercise can improve performance but this treatment is not practical for day-to-day living. A diet rich in carbohydrate may be superior to a diet rich in protein. Adverse effects were reported in four studies. Oral ribose caused symptoms suggestive of a low blood sugar including light-headedness, hunger and diarrhoea. One study of branched chain amino acids resulted in a deterioration in participants. Dantrolene was reported to cause a number of side-effects including tiredness, sleepiness, dizziness and muscle weakness. Low dose creatine (60 mg/kg/day) did not cause any side-effects but high-dose creatine (150 mg/kg/day) worsened the symptoms of muscle pain. The quality of these studies was low due to the small number of participants; the largest number in one trial was 19 and one trial had only one participant. The evidence is current to August 2014."
CD009453,"We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants. All were randomised trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data. Seventeen of the studies had student populations. Most of the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection bias. Findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes (n = 1196) were mixed, with effects showing a reduction, increase or consistent with no evidence of effect. The median standardised mean difference (SMD) for the three trials (n = 394) with continuous outcomes was -0.25, with SMDs ranging from -0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.39 to -0.31) to -0.17 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.20). Odds ratios (OR) for the two studies (n = 802) with dichotomous discrimination outcomes showed no evidence of effect: results were 1.30 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.19) and 1.19 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.65). The 19 trials (n = 3176) with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention, at the three following time periods: -0.38 (immediate), -0.38 (1 week to 2 months) and -0.49 (6 to 9 months). SMDs for prejudice outcomes across all studies ranged from -2.94 (95% CI -3.52 to -2.37) to 2.40 (95% CI 0.62 to 4.18). The median SMDs indicate that mass media interventions may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice, and are equivalent to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with schizophrenia to that associated with major depression. The studies were very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, interventions and outcomes, and only two meta-analyses within two subgroups were warranted. Data on secondary outcomes were sparse. Cost data were provided on request for three studies (n = 416), were highly variable, and did not address cost-effectiveness. Two studies (n = 455) contained statements about adverse effects and neither reported finding any. Mass media interventions may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes. Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents. The findings are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review. Such research should use robust methods, report data more consistently with reporting guidelines and be less reliant on student populations.","We reviewed studies comparing people who saw or heard a mass media intervention about mental health problems with people who had not seen or heard any intervention, or who had seen an intervention which contained nothing about mental ill health or stigma. We aimed to find out what effects mass media interventions may have on reducing stigma towards people with mental health problems. We found 22 studies involving 4490 people. Five of these studies had data about discrimination and 19 had data about prejudice. We found that mass media interventions may reduce, increase, or have no effect on discrimination. We found that mass media interventions may reduce prejudice. The amount of the reduction can be considered as small to medium, and is similar to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with schizophrenia to that associated with major depression. The quality of the evidence about discrimination and prejudice was low, so we cannot be very certain about these findings. Only three studies gave any information about financial costs and two about adverse affects, and there were limitations in how they assessed these, so we cannot draw conclusions about these aspects."
CD002221,We identified one RCT which met our inclusion criteria and was included in this review. Sixty-three participants with primary involutional lower eyelid entropion were randomised to everting sutures alone or everting sutures with a lateral tarsal strip. Eight participants were lost to follow-up. The trial indicates that the combined procedure for horizontal and vertical eyelid tightening in the form of everting sutures and lateral tarsal strip is highly curative for involutional entropion compared to vertical tightening in the form of everting sutures alone. The superiority of the combined approach is also supported by many good quality uncontrolled studies on specific surgical procedures but these were not included in the analysis as they were not part of the inclusion criteria. A single RCT showed that the combination of horizontal and vertical eyelid tightening with everting sutures and lateral tarsal strip is highly efficient for entropion compared to vertical tightening with everting sutures alone. Retrospective case series studies also support the combined surgical repair but details from these studies on specific surgical techniques cannot be included in the analysis. Evidence from a single RCT is unlikely to change clinical practice and thus it is still our view that there is a clear need for more randomised studies comparing two or more surgical techniques for entropion surgery addressing the recurrence and complications rate.,The review authors searched the medical literature and found a single trial that met the inclusion criteria of the review. Sixty-three participants with lower eyelid entropion were enrolled and randomised to either everting sutures alone or everting sutures and a lateral tarsal strip. Eight participants were lost to follow-up. The trial showed that the combination of horizontal and vertical eyelid tightening with everting sutures and lateral tarsal strip is highly efficient for entropion compared to vertical tightening with everting sutures alone. Further research is needed to provide more credible evidence for the comparison of surgical treatments to correct an inward turning eyelid.
CD012502,"We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life. Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.","This evidence is current up to July 2018. We included 26 studies involving 23,499 participants. These studies assessed the effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-lowering drugs versus lipid-lowering drugs alone for heart disease. The participants were adults, and most of them had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk for combined outcome of death due to heart disease, heart attack or stroke, but the benefit is moderate. However, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate have little or no effect on death from any cause. Treatment with ezetimibe and statin probably reduces the risk for non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal stroke. Adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate probably have little or no effect on heart-related death. Ezetimibe with statins might reduce the need for coronary revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery. In terms of safety, we do not have enough evidence to know whether ezetimibe increases or decreases side-effects (e.g. liver injury, muscle pain, cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation). The analysis of blood lipids revealed that the addition of ezetimibe statin or fenofibrate therapy might further reduce the levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides, and likely increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ('good' cholesterol). None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life. There is a lack of evidence supporting the use of ezetimibe monotherapy for the prevention of heart disease, and this topic requires further investigation. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low across the outcomes."
CD007744,"There were no RCTs that assessed the tolerability or safety of the withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, valdecoxib, or lumiracoxib. Two RCTs (n = 381 IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations) were included in the review. One study (n = 159) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The other study (n = 222) compared celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis. Both studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The two included studies were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in patient populations and treatment duration. There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of IBD between etoricoxib and placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment the IBD exacerbation rate was 17% (14/82) in the etoricoxib group compared to 19% (15/77) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.69). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (29 events). There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of ulcerative colitis between celecoxib and placebo. After two weeks of treatment 4% (5/112) of celecoxib patients experienced an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis compared to 6% (7/110) of patients in the placebo group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.14). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (12 events). The study comparing etoricoxib to placebo documented but did not report on AEs. The proportion of patients who experienced AEs was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively, P > 0.20). No patients in either group died or experienced serious adverse events. Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI AEs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.07). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (24 events). GI AEs led to premature withdrawal from the study in 3% of patients in celecoxib and placebo groups respectively. GI AEs included increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular adverse events. Renal toxicity or thrombotic AEs were not reported. The results for disease exacerbation and AEs between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and etoricoxib and placebo were uncertain. Thus no definitive conclusions regarding the tolerability and safety of the short term use of celecoxib and etoricoxib in patients with IBD can be drawn. The two included studies suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies had relatively small sample sizes and short follow-up durations. Clinicians need to continue to weigh the risks and benefits of these drugs when treating patients IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations in order to avoid disease exacerbation and other adverse effects. Further RCTs are needed to determine the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib in these patients.","This review does not include any studies that assessed the tolerability and safety of the withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, valdecoxib, or lumiracoxib.This review identified two studies that included a total of 381 participants with IBD who were experiencing rheumatological manifestations. One study (159 participants) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) in people with IBD (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) who were in remission (i.e. no disease symptoms) or had active disease (i.e. had symptoms). The other study (222 participants) compared 2 weeks of treatment with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in people with ulcerative colitis who were in remission. The study that compared etoricoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of IBD after 12 weeks of treatment. Although this study documented side effects experienced by the participants these side effects were not reported in the study manuscript. The study that compared celecoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of ulcerative colitis after two weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients who experienced side effects was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively). No patients in either group died or experienced serious side effects. Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI side effects including increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular side effects (i.e. heart attack or stroke). Renal toxicity (i.e. the poisonous effect of a substance on the kidneys) or thrombotic side effects (i.e. the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel) were not reported. The results of the two included studies in this review suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies assessed relatively small numbers of patients and were of short duration. Futhermore, the overall quality of the evidence from the studies was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results. No firm conclusions on the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib can be drawn from these studies. Further studies are needed to determine the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib in patients with rheumatological manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease."
CD005106,"Of the 15 selected trials, three were rated low risk of bias. Three TPE themes emerged. Advice focusing on activation: There is moderate quality evidence (one trial, 348 participants) that an educational video of advice focusing on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain when compared with no treatment at intermediate-term [RR 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.06)] but not long-term follow-up [0.89 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.21)]. There is low quality evidence (one trial, 102 participants) that a whiplash pamphlet on advice focusing on activation is less beneficial for pain reduction, or no different in improving function and global perceived improvement from generic information given out in emergency care (control) for acute whiplash at short- or intermediate-term follow-up. Low to very low quality evidence (nine trials using diverse educational approaches) showed either no evidence of benefit or difference for varied outcomes. Advice focusing on pain & stress coping skills and workplace ergonomics: Very low quality evidence (three trials, 243 participants) favoured other treatment or showed no difference spanning numerous follow-up periods and disorder subtypes. Low quality evidence (one trial, 192 participants) favoured specific exercise training for chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up. Self-care strategies: Very low quality evidence (one trial, 58 participants) indicated that self-care strategies did not relieve pain for acute to chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up. With the exception of one trial, this review has not shown effectiveness for educational interventions, including advice to activate, advice on stress-coping skills, workplace ergonomics and self-care strategies. Future research should be founded on sound adult learning theory and learning skill acquisition.","Electronic bibliographic databases were searched up to 11 July 2010. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (1660 participants) looking at the effectiveness of patient education strategies for neck disorders were included. Of the 15 selected trials, only one trial depicting moderate quality evidence favoured the educational video for acute WAD. The remaining trials showed that patient education trials did not demonstrate evidence of benefit or favoured the comparison treatment being exercise for pain. Other outcomes were less frequently reported and did not yield results that diverged from those associated with pain. Participants who received advice to stay active reported little or no difference in pain compared with those who received no treatment, treatments focusing on rest, treatments focusing on exercise, physiotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. Additionally, stress-management therapies, when compared with no treatment, did not seem to have an effect on pain intensity in patients with mechanical neck disorders. Finally, self-care strategies (ergonomics, exercise, self-care, relaxation) do not seem to have an effect on pain when compared with no treatment. No adverse events were reported in the trials. In summary, the review authors concluded that there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of educational interventions in various neck disorders."
CD002816,No randomised controlled trials or controlled trials were found that examined the efficacy of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy for the treatment of dysphagia in Parkinson's disease. However there is one large RCT currently recruiting patients that will compare 'chin down' posture with thickened liquids in the treatment of dysphagia. The main outcomes will be the rates of aspiration and pneumonia. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the efficacy of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy for dysphagia in Parkinson's disease. Large well designed placebo-controlled RCTs are required to assess the effectiveness of swallowing therapy for dysphagia in Parkinson's disease and reported according to CONSORT guidelines. Suitable outcome measures should be chosen so that the efficacy and effectiveness of non-pharmacological swallowing therapy can be assessed and an economic analysis performed. Outcomes which have meaning to patients and carers should be used wherever possible since they need to know the value of this therapy in practical terms. The patients should be followed for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any improvement.,"Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) were eligible for this review. In RCTs the patients are assigned to each of the groups in a random fashion so as to reduce the potential for bias. Either one group of patients had swallowing therapy, the other had a sham treatment or no treatment, or two forms of swallowing therapy were compared to each other. There were no controlled trials, randomised or otherwise, in this field. Therefore there is no trial evidence to prove or disprove the benefit of swallowing therapy for the treatment of swallowing disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. It should be emphasised that this lack of evidence does not mean lack of effect. There is one large RCT currently recruiting patients that will compare 'chin down' posture with thickened liquids in the treatment of dysphagia. The main outcomes in this study will be the rates of aspiration and pneumonia. Large well designed placebo-controlled RCTs are needed to assess the effectiveness of swallowing therapy for swallowing disorders in Parkinson's disease. The design of the trials should minimise bias and be reported fully using CONSORT guidelines. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients should be chosen and the patients followed for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any improvement."
CD005421,"Studies involved 15,940 United States youth; participants were ethnically diverse. Seven programs were school-based, two were community-based, and one was delivered in family homes. Median final follow-up occurred 17 months after baseline. Results showed no indications that abstinence-only programs can reduce HIV risk as indicated by self-reported biological and behavioral outcomes. Compared to various controls, the evaluated programs consistently did not affect incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, frequency of vaginal sex, number of partners, sexual initiation, or condom use. One study found a significantly protective effect for incidence of recent vaginal sex (n=839), but this was limited to short-term follow-up, countered by measurement error, and offset by six studies with non-significant results (n=2615). One study found significantly harmful effects for STI incidence (n=2711), pregnancy incidence (n=1548), and frequency of vaginal sex (n=338); these effects were also offset by studies with non-significant findings. Methodological strengths included large samples, efforts to improve self-report, and analyses controlling for baseline values. Weaknesses included underutilization of relevant outcomes, underreporting of key data, self-report bias, and analyses neglecting attrition and clustered randomization. Evidence does not indicate that abstinence-only interventions effectively decrease or exacerbate HIV risk among participants in high-income countries; trials suggest that the programs are ineffective, but generalizability may be limited to US youth. Should funding continue, additional resources could support rigorous evaluations with behavioral or biological outcomes. More trials comparing abstinence-only and abstinence-plus interventions are needed.","This review included thirteen randomized controlled trials comparing abstinence-only programs to various control groups (e.g., ""usual care,"" no intervention). Although we conducted an extensive international search for trials, all included studies enrolled youth in the US (total baseline enrollment=15,940 participants). Programs were conducted in schools, community centers, and family homes; all were delivered in family units or groups of young people. We could not conduct a meta-analysis because of missing data and variation in program designs. However, findings from the individual trials were remarkably consistent. Overall, the trials did not indicate that abstinence-only programs can reduce HIV risk as indicated by behavioral outcomes (e.g., unprotected vaginal sex) or biological outcomes (e.g., sexually transmitted infection). Instead, the programs consistently had no effect on participants' incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, frequency of vaginal sex, number of sex partners, sexual initiation, or condom use. One trial favored an abstinence-only program over usual care for incidence of vaginal sex (n=839), but this was limited to two-month follow-up and was offset by measurement error and six other studies with non-significant effects (n=2615). One evaluation found several significant adverse (harmful) program effects: abstinence-only program participants were more likely than usual-care controls to report sexually transmitted infections (n=2711), pregnancy (n=1548), and increased frequency of vaginal sex (n=338). These effects were offset by high attrition and other studies showing non-significant effects. We concluded that abstinence-only programs do not appear to reduce or exacerbate HIV risk among participants in high-income countries, although this evidence might not apply beyond US youth. Trial limitations included underreporting of relevant outcomes, reliance on program participants to report their behaviors accurately, and methodological weaknesses in the trials."
CD012546,"Our search yielded 5073 references, but at the end of our selection process, only 16 studies fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Nine of these provided individual participant data. We analysed only data concerning TSBA, cholic acid (CA), glycocholic acid (GCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and CA/CDCA because the remaining planned index tests were assessed in few studies. Only one study had low risk of bias in all four QUADAS-2 domains. The most biased domains were the patient sampling and the reference standard domains. When considering all studies with a cut-off of 10 μmol/L, TSBA overall sensitivity ranged from 0.72 to 0.98 and specificity ranged from 0.81 to 0.97. After a sensitivity analysis excluding case-control studies, TSBA sensitivity ranged from 0.48 to 0.66 and specificity from 0.52 to 0.99. After a sensitivity analysis excluding studies in which TSBA was part of the reference standard, TSBA sensitivity ranged from 0.49 to 0.65 and specificity from 0.53 to 0.99. We found the estimates of the overall accuracy for some serum bile acid components (CA, GCA, CDCA, and CA/CDCA) to be imprecise, with the CI for sensitivity and specificity very wide or impossible to calculate. Indirect comparisons between serum bile acid profile components and TSBA were not statistically significant. None of the heterogeneity analysis performed was statistically significant, except for the timing of assessment of TSBA (onset of symptoms, peak value among multiple assessments, delivery) but without clinically relevant results. We could not analyse the diagnostic accuracy of combinations of index tests because none of the included studies carried them out, and because of the small number of included studies. The overall high risk of bias, the existing concern regarding applicability of the results in clinical practice, and the great heterogeneity of the results in the included studies prevents us from making recommendations and reaching definitive conclusions at the present time. Thus, we do not find any compelling evidence to recommend or refute the routine use of any of these tests in clinical practice. So far, the diagnostic accuracy of TSBA for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy might have been overestimated. There were too few studies to permit a precise estimate of the accuracy of serum bile acid profile components. Further primary clinical research is mandatory. We need both further phase II and phase III diagnostic studies.","This review considered all evidence provided by studies that assess the diagnostic accuracy of total serum bile acids (TSBA) and any component of serum bile acid profile for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in woman claiming onset of pruritus during pregnancy. We assessed all available reports from a wide, systematic search of databases of medical literature, irrespective of design, publication status, language, and study design. We finally included 16 studies, most of them assessing the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of TSBA with a cut-off of 10 μmol/L. Most studies had a case-control design, and these studies could have overestimated the diagnostic accuracy. When considering the studies with a cut-off of 10 μmol/L for TSBA serum concentration, TSBA overall sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify women with the disease) ranged from 72% to 98% and specificity (the ability to correctly identify women without the disease) ranged from 81% to 97%. However, after performing two different analyses excluding studies with probably less reliable results, the diagnostic accuracy seemed lower. We calculated the overall accuracy also of some components of serum bile acid profile, but the small number of studies and the high variability of the results led to very imprecise data. Only one of the 16 included studies was performed and reported well (low risk of bias). The remaining 15 studies had problems with study design or reporting (high risk of bias). Only five studies seemed to show low concern regarding applicability of the results in clinical practice. The overall high risk of bias, the existing concern regarding applicability of the results in clinical practice, and the poor uniformity of our results in the included studies prevents us from making recommendations and reaching definitive conclusions at present. Thus, we do not find any compelling evidence to recommend or refute the routine use of any of these tests in clinical practice. So far, the diagnostic accuracy of TSBA for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy might have been overestimated. There were too few studies to permit a precise estimate of the accuracy of serum bile acid profile components. Further primary clinical research is mandatory. We need both further phase II and phase III diagnostic studies."
CD009266,"Eleven studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants were included in this review. The quality of evidence is hampered by risk of bias. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.48, six studies, 2712 participants) and increased clinical progression (one year: risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, five studies, 2067 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, six studies, 2373 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25, three studies, 1336 participants), as well as treatment failure (one year: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38, four studies, 1539 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.52, five studies, 1845 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24, two studies, 808 participants), compared with medical or surgical castration. The quality of evidence for overall survival, clinical progression and treatment failure was rated as moderate according to GRADE. Predefined subgroup analyses showed that use of non-steroidal antiandrogens, compared with castration, was less favourable for overall survival, clinical progression (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) and treatment failure (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) in men with metastatic disease. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens also increased the risk for treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.94, eight studies, 1559 participants), including events such as breast pain (RR 22.97, 95% CI 14.79 to 35.67, eight studies, 2670 participants), gynaecomastia (RR 8.43, 95% CI 3.19 to 22.28, nine studies, 2774 participants) and asthenia (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.31, five studies, 2073 participants). The risk of other adverse events, such as hot flashes (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.27, nine studies, 2774 participants), haemorrhage (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54, two studies, 546 participants), nocturia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.69, one study, 480 participants), fatigue (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88, one study, 51 participants), loss of sexual interest (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, one study, 51 participants) and urinary frequency (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47, one study, 480 participants) was decreased when non-steroidal antiandrogens were used. The quality of evidence for breast pain, gynaecomastia and hot flashes was rated as moderate according to GRADE. The effects of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear. Currently available evidence suggests that use of non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with medical or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer is less effective in terms of overall survival, clinical progression, treatment failure and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Evidence quality was rated as moderate according to GRADE. Further research is likely to have an important impact on results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer treated with non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy. However, we believe that research is likely not necessary on non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Only high-quality, randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up should be conducted. If further research is planned to investigate biochemical progression, studies with standardised follow-up schedules using measurements of prostate-specific antigen based on current guidelines should be conducted.","The evidence is current to December 2013. We included 11 studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants at advanced stages of prostate cancer. The follow-up period of participants ranged from six months to six years. In seven studies, authors reported possible conflicts of interest. In three studies, no conflicts of interest were declared. In one study, authors reported that they had received an educational grant from the sponsor, who had no role in any aspect of analysis or data interpretation. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival and increased clinical progression and treatment failure. Subgroup analyses showed that non-steroidal antiandrogens, compared with castration, were less favourable for overall survival, for clinical progression and for treatment failure in men with metastatic disease. Participants receiving antiandrogens were also more likely to stop treatment as the result of side effects. The risk of suffering breast pain, enlargement of breast tissue or symptoms of physical weakness was also increased with non-steroidal antiandrogens. The risks of feeling intense heat with sweating and rapid heartbeat and of bleeding, the need to get up in the night to urinate, loss of sexual interest, extreme tiredness and the need to urinate more often than usual were increased with castration. No difference was noted for other side effects. The effect of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear. Included studies were poorly conducted, and the quality of evidence was rated as moderate. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the accuracy of results."
CD012245,"We included 91 studies that evaluated seven tests — blood tests for human placental lactogen (hPL), oestriol, placental growth factor (PlGF) and uric acid, ultrasound EFW and placental grading and urinary oestriol — in a total of 175,426 pregnant women, in which 15,471 pregnancies ended in the birth of a small baby and 740 pregnancies which ended in stillbirth. The quality of included studies was variable with most domains at low risk of bias although 59% of studies were deemed to be of unclear risk of bias for the reference standard domain. Fifty-three per cent of studies were of high concern for applicability due to inclusion of only high- or low-risk women. Using all available data for SGA (86 studies; 159,490 pregnancies involving 15,471 SGA infants), there was evidence of a difference in accuracy (P < 0.0001) between the seven tests for detecting pregnancies that are SGA at birth. Ultrasound EFW was the most accurate test for detecting SGA at birth with a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 21.3 (95% CI 13.1 to 34.6); hPL was the most accurate biochemical test with a DOR of 4.78 (95% CI 3.21 to 7.13). In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 pregnant women, at the median specificity of 0.88 and median prevalence of 19%, EFW, hPL, oestriol, urinary oestriol, uric acid, PlGF and placental grading will miss 50 (95% CI 32 to 68), 116 (97 to 133), 124 (108 to 137), 127 (95 to 152), 139 (118 to 154), 144 (118 to 161), and 144 (122 to 161) SGA infants, respectively. For the detection of pregnancies ending in stillbirth (21 studies; 100,687 pregnancies involving 740 stillbirths), in an indirect comparison of the four biochemical tests, PlGF was the most accurate test with a DOR of 49.2 (95% CI 12.7 to 191). In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 pregnant women, at the median specificity of 0.78 and median prevalence of 1.7%, PlGF, hPL, urinary oestriol and uric acid will miss 2 (95% CI 0 to 4), 4 (2 to 8), 6 (6 to 7) and 8 (3 to 13) stillbirths, respectively. No studies assessed the accuracy of ultrasound EFW for detection of pregnancy ending in stillbirth. Biochemical markers of placental dysfunction used alone have insufficient accuracy to identify pregnancies ending in SGA or stillbirth. Studies combining U and placental biomarkers are needed to determine whether this approach improves diagnostic accuracy over the use of ultrasound estimation of fetal size or biochemical markers of placental dysfunction used alone. Many of the studies included in this review were carried out between 1974 and 2016. Studies of placental substances were mostly carried out before 1991 and after 2013; earlier studies may not reflect developments in test technology.","Of the 91 included studies, 86 had information on small babies, of which 18 also looked at stillbirth; another five studies only looked at stillbirth. The most accurate test for detecting a small baby was ultrasound scan to estimate a baby’s weight. Of the substances measured in mother’s blood, human placental lactogen (hPL), a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy, was the most accurate. There was only one study which looked at both ultrasound scanning and measurement of a placental substance. Placental growth factor (PlGF) was the most accurate test of a placental substance to identify a baby that would be stillborn; there were no studies of ultrasound scanning to detect a baby that would be stillborn. Tests of placental substances were better at identifying a baby at risk of stillbirth than detecting a small baby. Many of the studies included in this review were carried out between 1974 and 2016. Studies of placental substances were mostly carried out before 1991 and after 2013; earlier studies may not reflect developments in test technology. More studies are needed to find out whether a combination of ultrasound scans and mother’s blood tests could improve identification of pregnancies which end in the birth of a small baby or in a stillborn baby. No studies were identified for this review that looked at the accuracy of ultrasound and blood tests used together."
CD002001,"Sixteen trials, with a combined total of 3299 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence was moderate for recurrent VTE, low for major bleeding, and moderate for mortality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for imprecision (recurrent VTE, mortality) and for risk of bias and inconsistency (major bleeding). We found no clear differences in recurrent VTE between LMWH and VKA (Peto OR 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.15; P = 0.27; 3299 participants; 16 studies; moderate-quality evidence). We found less bleeding with LMWH than with VKA (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.80; P = 0.004; 3299 participants; 16 studies; low-quality evidence). However, when comparing only high-quality studies for bleeding, we observed no clear differences between LMWH and VKA (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07; P = 0.08; 1872 participants; seven studies). We found no clear differences between LMWH and VKA in terms of mortality (Peto OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.56; P = 0.68; 3299 participants; 16 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence shows no clear differences between LMWH and VKA in preventing symptomatic VTE and death after an episode of symptomatic DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests fewer cases of major bleeding with LMWH than with VKA. However, comparison of only high-quality studies for bleeding shows no clear differences between LMWH and VKA. LMWH may represent an alternative for some patients, for example, those residing in geographically inaccessible areas, those who are unable or reluctant to visit the thrombosis service regularly, and those with contraindications to VKA.","The quality of evidence for the outcomes recurrent blood clots and death was moderate. The quality of this evidence was downgraded because of the small number of events reported, leading to imprecision. For the outcome bleeding, the quality of evidence was low because of inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. Continued research into long term treatment of blood clots in the veins with LMWH and VKA is needed. This review found no clear differences in recurrent blood clots and death between LMWH and VKA, and fewer bleeding episodes with LMWH than with VKA. However, when only high-quality studies were compared for bleeding, no clear differences were observed between LMWH and VKA. LMWH may offer an alternative for some patients, for example, those in geographically inaccessible areas, those unable or reluctant to visit the thrombosis service regularly, and those for whom taking VKA may be harmful."
CD003961,"123 reports from 30 studies (4102 patients) were included. At six months graft loss was significantly reduced in tacrolimus-treated recipients (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.86), and this effect was persistent up to three years. Meta-regression showed that this benefit diminished as higher trough levels of tacrolimus were targeted (P = 0.04), after allowing for differences in cyclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) and cyclosporin target trough level (P = 0.38). At one year, tacrolimus patients suffered less acute rejection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79), and less steroid-resistant rejection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64), but more insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (RR 1.86, 1.11 to 3.09), tremor, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and vomiting. Cyclosporin-treated recipients experienced significantly more constipation and cosmetic side-effects. We demonstrated no differences in infection or malignancy. Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post-transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid 12 suffering acute rejection, two losing their graft but cause an extra five to become insulin-requiring diabetics.","This review compared tacrolimus and cyclosporin used as primary immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients. Thirty studies (4102 patients) were included. Tacrolimus was shown to be superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post-transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. There was insufficient information to assess the cost of tacrolimus versus cyclosporin, and there was a general failure to consider global quality of life (QOL) for transplant recipients which may inform our understanding of patient preference and compliance."
MR000039,"The 33 eligible studies largely compared open questions with checklist-type questions or rating scales. Two included participant interviews. Despite different designs, populations and details of questioning methods, the narrative review showed that more specific questioning of participants led to more AEs detected compared to a more general enquiry. A subset of six studies suggested that more severe, bothersome, or otherwise clinically relevant AEs were reported when an initial open enquiry was used, while some less severe, bothersome, or clinically relevant AEs were only reported with a subsequent specific enquiry. However, two studies showed that quite severe or debilitating AEs were only detected by an interview, while other studies did not find a difference in the nature of AEs between elicitation methods. No conclusions could be made regarding the impact of question method on the ability to detect a statistically significant difference between study groups. There was no common statistical rubric, but we were able to represent some effect measures as a risk ratio of the proportion of participants with at least one AE. This showed a lower level of reporting for open questions (O) compared to checklists (CL), with a range for the risk ratios of 0.12 to 0.64. This review supports concerns that methods to elicit participant-reported AEs influence the detection of these data. There was a risk for under-detection of AEs in studies using a more general elicitation method compared to those using a comprehensive method. These AEs may be important from a clinical perspective or for patients. This under-detection could compromise ability to pool AE data. However, the impact on the nature of the AE detected by different methods is unclear. The wide variety and low quality of methods to compare elicitation strategies limited this review. Future studies would be improved by using and reporting clear definitions and terminology for AEs (and other important variables), frequency and time period over which they were ascertained, how they were graded, assessed for a relationship to the study drug, coded, and tabulated/reported. While the many potential AE endpoints in a trial may preclude the development of general AE patient-reported outcome measurement instruments, much could also be learnt from how these employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand data elicited. Any chosen questioning method needs to be feasible for use by both staff and participants.","Clinical drug trials or studies are usually conducted to assess how well the drug works but also whether it causes any harm (side effects or adverse effects). Adverse effects can be detected by the trial doctor examining participants or taking some blood samples or doing other kinds of tests. The trial staff can also ask participants about how they are feeling after taking the trial drug. However, the way participants are asked about their health can vary from trial to trial, or even within a trial. In some trials, participants may be asked a simple open question such as 'how have you been feeling? ', while in other trials, participants may be asked about whether they have had any of a long list of possible symptoms (such as 'have you had a headache, stomach ache, or sore muscles?'). There has been concern that these different kinds of questions and how they are phrased will impact on what participants report about their health during a trial. This might then affect the trial's results and what we know about the side effects of drugs. We did this review to look at studies that compared different types of participant questioning methods in order to investigate these issues. We found 33 studies comparing mainly open questions with checklist-type questions, but also some ratings scales and participant interviews. While the studies were all very different in terms of the types of disease, drugs, and patients studied, we found in general that, as would be expected, when a more specific type of question was asked (like a checklist), participants reported more symptoms. What is interesting is that, in those studies that looked more closely at the types of symptoms reported, it seems that an open question picks up the more severe or bothersome symptoms compared to a checklist-type question. However, some studies found that even quite severe or bothersome symptoms were not reported when a participant is asked an open question and these severe symptoms will only be reported with the more specific question. This makes it difficult to say whether one method is better than any other and the different questioning methods may, in fact, be complementary and therefore should be used together. It is also difficult to say what a specific question should include, as it might take too long for a participant to have to answer a very long list. While more research is needed to resolve the remaining uncertainties, it is very important for trials to be clear about which kind of questioning was used when they publish their results. This will help readers understand the trial's findings about the side effects and make it easier to make accurate comparisons between trials."
CD004233,"Ten studies (1785 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The two new studies in this update had been identified in the earlier update, but data were not available. There remain three potentially relevant unpublished studies for which data are not available at this time. The NNT for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg compared with placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours was 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 5.6) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.0) respectively. The median time to use of rescue medication was 6.6 hours with celecoxib 200 mg, 8.4 hours with celecoxib 400 mg, and 2.3 hours with placebo. The proportion of participants requiring rescue medication over 24 hours was 74% with celecoxib 200 mg, 63% for celecoxib 400 mg, and 91% for placebo. The NNT to prevent one patient using rescue medication was 4.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 7.7) and 3.5 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.6) for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg respectively. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and were experienced by a similar proportion of participants in the celecoxib and placebo groups. One serious adverse event that was probably related to celecoxib was reported. Single-dose oral celecoxib is an effective analgesic for postoperative pain relief. Indirect comparison suggests that the 400 mg dose has similar efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg.","This review assessed information from 10 studies which used celecoxib for acute pain. Just over 3 in 10 people (33%) taking celecoxib 200 mg, and over 4 in 10 (43%) taking celecoxib 400 mg, experienced good pain relief (at least 50%) compared to about 1 in 10 (range 1% to 11%) with placebo. Comparing the results of the different studies showed that the 200 mg dose of celecoxib was at least as good as aspirin 600 to 650 mg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1000 mg for relieving postoperative pain, while a 400 mg dose was at least as good as ibuprofen 400 mg. The number of people who experienced negative (adverse) reactions was similar for celecoxib and placebo, and stopping the medication due to these adverse reactions also occurred at similar rates. One serious adverse event, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), was probably related to celecoxib."
CD009608,"The review includes 24 studies (1900 participants). All studies compared group CBTp with treatments that a person with schizophrenia would normally receive in a standard mental health service (standard care) or any other psychosocial intervention (group or individual). None of the studies compared group CBTp with individual CBTp. Overall risk of bias within the trials was moderate to low. We found no studies reporting data for our primary outcome of clinically important change. With regard to numbers of participants leaving the study early, group CBTp has little or no effect compared to standard care or other psychosocial interventions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.59; studies = 13, participants = 1267; I2 = 9%; low-certainty evidence). Group CBTp may have some advantage over standard care or other psychosocial interventions for overall mental state at the end of treatment for endpoint scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total (MD –3.73, 95% CI –4.63 to –2.83; studies = 12, participants = 1036; I2 = 5%; low-certainty evidence). Group CBTp seems to have little or no effect on PANSS positive symptoms (MD –0.45, 95% CI –1.30 to 0.40; studies =8, participants = 539; I2 = 0%) and on PANSS negative symptoms scores at the end of treatment (MD –0.73, 95% CI –1.68 to 0.21; studies = 9, participants = 768; I2 = 65%). Group CBTp seems to have an advantage over standard care or other psychosocial interventions on global functioning measured by Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF; MD –3.61, 95% CI –6.37 to –0.84; studies = 5, participants = 254; I2 = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP; MD 3.30, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.60; studies = 1, participants = 100), and Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS; MD –1.27, 95% CI –2.46 to –0.08; studies = 1, participants = 116). Service use data were equivocal with no real differences between treatment groups for number of participants hospitalised (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.60; studies = 3, participants = 235; I2 = 34%). There was no clear difference between group CBTp and standard care or other psychosocial interventions endpoint scores on depression and quality of life outcomes, except for quality of life measured by World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) Psychological domain subscale (MD –4.64, 95% CI –9.04 to –0.24; studies = 2, participants = 132; I2 = 77%). The studies did not report relapse or adverse effects. Group CBTp appears to be no better or worse than standard care or other psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia in terms of leaving the study early, service use and general quality of life. Group CBTp seems to be more effective than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on overall mental state and global functioning scores. These results may not be widely applicable as each study had a low sample size. Therefore, no firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of group CBTp for people with schizophrenia can currently be made. More high-quality research, reporting useable and relevant data is needed.",We found 24 studies involving 1900 participants that met the review requirements and provided usable data. All studies compared group CBTp with standard care. Our evidence suggests there is no substantial difference between group CBTp and standard care or other psychosocial interventions in terms of numbers of participants leaving the study early. Group CBTp may be better than standard care or other psychosocial interventions for overall mental state for total symptoms of schizophrenia. Group CBTp seems to show no difference on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to standard care or other psychosocial interventions. Group CBTp seems to be better than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on global functioning. There were no real differences between treatment groups for number of participants hospitalised for group CBTp compared to standard care or other psychosocial interventions. Group CBTp seems to be better than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on total symptoms of schizophrenia and global functioning. Studies with larger sample sizes and low risk of bias should be conducted. Longer-term outcomes need to be addressed to establish whether any effect is transient or long-lasting. Trials should improve their quality of data reporting.
CD005335,"Three trials met eligibility criteria. A 16-week behaviour therapy intervention was used in two trials, and a 12-week cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention in the third. Duration of follow-up varied, ranging from 0 to 12 months. Two trials (total 166 participants) provided data comparing combination with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy). No statistically significant differences were observed in response during the intervention (relative risk (RR) for combination 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.03, P = 0.35), at the end of the intervention (RR 0.78, 0.45 to 1.35, P = 0.37), or at the last follow-up time point, although the follow-up data suggested that the combination might be inferior to behaviour therapy alone (RR 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.08). One trial (77 participants) compared combination with a benzodiazepine alone. No differences were found in response during the intervention (RR 1.57, 0.83 to 2.98, P = 0.17). Although the combination appeared to be superior to the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment (RR 3.39, 1.03 to 11.21, P = 0.05) the finding was only borderline statistically significant, and no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up (RR 2.31, 0.79 to 6.74, P = 0.12). The review established the paucity of high quality evidence investigating the efficacy of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for panic disorder. Currently, there is inadequate evidence to assess the clinical effects of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for patients who are diagnosed with panic disorder.","This review included randomised controlled trials comparing the combination of psychotherapy and a benzodiazepine with either the psychotherapy or the benzodiazapine alone for people with panic disorder. We were able to include only three trials in this review. Two could be used in the comparison of the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepine versus psychotherapy alone and one in the comparison of the combination with benzodiazepine. These comparisons involved just 166 patients and 77 patients, respectively. These small numbers make it difficult to detect any differences between combination treatments and either treatment alone. The trials which compared the combination of treatments with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy) indicated no differences in response between the two approaches, either during the intervention, at the end of the intervention, or at the last follow-up time point. The trial which compared the combination of treatments with a benzodiazepine alone demonstrated no differences in response during the intervention. Although the combination of treatments appeared to be more effective than the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment, no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up. Before evidence-based treatment recommendations are possible, more randomised controlled trials are required, comparing the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepines with either treatment alone, and involving enough people to be able to detect a true difference between the treatments if one exists."
CD011195,"We found no RCT and thus no available data for evaluation of the primary outcome (mortality) nor secondary outcomes or adverse effects. Therefore, we conducted no statistical analysis. A total of 73 observational studies reported on various clinically relevant outcomes following catheter removal or catheter retention. Most of these excluded, observational studies reported a beneficial effect of catheter removal in patients with candidaemia. None of the observational studies reported results in favour of retaining a catheter. However, the observational studies were very heterogeneous with regards to population, pathogens and interventions. Furthermore, they suffered from confounding by indication and an overall high risk of bias. As a consequence, we are not able to provide recommendations or to draw firm conclusions because of the difficulties involved in interpreting the results of these observational studies (very low quality of evidence, GRADE - Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group). Despite indications from observational studies in favour of early catheter removal, we found no eligible RCTs or quasi-RCTs to support these practices and therefore could draw no firm conclusions. At this stage, RCTs have provided no evidence to support the benefit of early or late catheter removal for survival or other important outcomes among patients with candidaemia; no evidence with regards to assessment of harm or benefit with prompt central venous catheter removal and subsequent re-insertion of new catheters to continue treatment; and no evidence on optimal timing of insertion of a new central venous catheter.","We found no clinical trials with a randomized controlled design that evaluated this topic and measured the number of deaths or any of our secondary outcomes. We identified 73 observational studies that delivered descriptive data on catheter management and survival in people with bloodstream infections caused by Candida. We identified no randomized controlled trials for statistical analyses and assessments. Therefore, we can present no results on the effect of catheter removal on survival when Candida is found in the bloodstream. A total of 73 observational studies reported relevant outcomes after the catheter was removed or was kept in place. In all, 40 studies reported a beneficial effect of catheter removal in patients with candidaemia, and 34 presented results showing no clear differences between groups. No studies reported results in favour of retaining the catheter. We found no reports on the harmful effects of removing a catheter and re-inserting a new catheter. No randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Consequently, we cannot assess the quality of evidence."
CD013420,"We included 24 studies (1639 participants) published between 1978 and 2021. Eleven studies were set in the USA, five in China, two in Sweden, three in Iran, and one each in the Netherlands, UK, and Germany. Participants' asthma severity ranged from mild to severe. Three studies included primary school-aged participants (five to 12 years), two included secondary school-aged participants (13 to 18 years), and 18 included both age groups, while one study was unclear on the age ranges. Durations of interventions ranged from three days to eight months. One intervention was conducted online and the rest were face-to-face. Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity (interventions, populations, outcome tools and definitions, and length of follow-up). We tabulated and summarised the results narratively with reference to direction, magnitude, and certainty of effects. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. A lack of information about scale metrics and minimal clinically important differences for the scales used to measure anxiety, depression, asthma symptoms, medication use, and quality of life made it difficult to judge clinical significance. Primary outcomes
Four studies (327 participants) reported beneficial or mixed effects of psychological interventions versus controls for symptoms of anxiety, and one found little to no difference between groups (104 participants). Two studies (166 participants) that evaluated symptoms of depression both reported benefits of psychological interventions compared to controls. Three small studies (92 participants) reported a reduction in medical contacts, but two larger studies (544 participants) found little or no difference between groups in this outcome. Two studies (107 participants) found that the intervention had an important beneficial effect on number of asthma attacks, and one small study (22 participants) found little or no effect of the intervention for this outcome. Secondary outcomes
Eleven studies (720 participants) assessed asthma symptoms; four (322 participants) reported beneficial effects of the intervention compared to control, five (257 participants) reported mixed or unclear findings, and two (131 participants) found little or no difference between groups. Eight studies (822 participants) reported a variety of medication use measures; six of these studies (670 participants) found a positive effect of the intervention versus control, and the other two (152 participants) found little or no difference between the groups. Across six studies (653 participants) reporting measures of quality of life, the largest three (522 participants) found little or no difference between the groups. Where findings were positive or mixed, there was evidence of selective reporting (2 studies, 131 participants). No studies provided data related to adverse effects. Most studies that reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, asthma attacks, asthma symptoms, and medication use found a positive effect of psychological interventions versus control on at least one measure. However, some findings were mixed, it was difficult to judge clinical significance, and the evidence for all outcomes is very uncertain due to clinical heterogeneity, small sample sizes, incomplete reporting, and risk of bias. There is limited evidence to suggest that psychological interventions can reduce the need for medical contact or improve quality of life, and no studies reported adverse events. It was not possible to identify components of effective interventions and distinguish these from interventions showing no evidence of an effect due to substantial heterogeneity. Future investigations of evidence-based psychological techniques should consider standardising outcomes to support cross-comparison and better inform patient and policymaker decision-making.","We wanted to find out whether psychological treatment was better than usual care, treatment without a psychological component, or no treatment for improving the following outcomes. 1. Symptoms of anxiety
2. Symptoms of depression
3. Medical contacts (such as hospital admissions or emergency department visits)
4. Asthma attacks
5. Asthma symptoms
6. Medication use
7. Quality of life
We also wanted to know whether psychological treatment had any unwanted effects in children and adolescents with asthma. We searched for studies that had evaluated psychological treatment (such as behavioural therapies, cognitive therapies, or counselling) compared to standard asthma care, treatment without a psychological component, or no treatment in girls and boys aged five to 18 years with asthma. We included 24 studies that had enroled 1639 children and adolescents. We found mixed results for nearly all outcomes in this review: many treatments showed benefits, but others showed no evidence of an effect. The results of some studies suggest that psychological interventions could be beneficial for children and adolescents with asthma, particularly to reduce symptoms of anxiety or depression, reduce asthma attacks, reduce asthma symptoms, and improve medication use. For most studies, it was difficult to judge how important the benefits were because the assessment scales were not well described. There is limited evidence that psychological interventions could reduce the need for medical contact or improve quality of life. No studies reported unwanted effects of treatment. Our results are very uncertain and difficult to interpret because the studies used different theories to develop their treatments, different tools to measure results, different follow-up periods, and different definitions for the outcomes (e.g. one study measured daytime symptoms while another measured total asthma symptoms). Because of these important differences, it was difficult to make comparisons between the studies. The number of children and adolescents was small in most studies, and some studies reported only part of their results. More high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base for using psychological treatment in children and adolescents with asthma, and to determine which types of psychological treatment might be most helpful. The evidence is current to February 2023."
CD008960,"A total of 16 randomised trials with 1326 patients were included. One trial with 42 participants compared phyllanthus with placebo. The trial found no significant difference in HBeAg seroconversion after the end of treatment (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.25) or follow-up (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.60). No other outcomes could be assessed. Fifteen trials compared phyllanthus plus an antiviral drug like interferon alpha, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, thymosin, vidarabine, or conventional treatment with the same antiviral drug alone. Phyllanthus did significantly affect serum HBV DNA (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91, P = 0.008; I2 = 71%), serum HBeAg (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.81, P < 0.00001; I2 = 68%), and HBeAg seroconversion (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.92, P = 0.005; I2 = 78%), but the heterogeneity was substantial. The result obtained regarding serum HBV DNA was not supported by trial sequential analysis. None of the trials reported mortality and hepatitis B-related morbidity, quality of life, or liver histology. Only two trials reported adverse events with numbers without significant differences. No serious adverse events were reported. There is no convincing evidence that phyllanthus compared with placebo benefits patients with chronic HBV infection. Phyllanthus plus an antiviral drug may be better than the same antiviral drug alone. However, heterogeneity, systematic errors, and random errors question the validity of the results. Clinical trials with large sample size and low risk of bias are needed to confirm our findings. Species of phyllanthus should be reported in future trials, and a dose-finding design is warranted.","The objective of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of phyllanthus species for patients with chronic HBV infection. Phyllanthus species appear to be safe and may potentially have effects on the clearance of viral markers in patients with HBV infection. However, all of the trials evaluated in this review were of low methodology quality, ie, have high risk of bias, and there was a risk of random errors in the majority of comparisons. Furthermore, all analyses showed substantial heterogeneity. Accordingly, randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and large sample size should be conducted to confirm the effects of phyllanthus species before clinical use is considered."
CD006857,"Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another. Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.","This review identified 16 studies investigating antibiotics for UTI in children. Results suggest that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments; there was not enough data to draw conclusions about other treatment durations, or effectiveness of particular antibiotics. Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific regimen."
CD007595,"We found 22 trials that evaluated pericoital use of LNG and other hormonal drugs on a regular basis to prevent pregnancy. The studies included a total of 12,400 participants, and were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs and doses evaluated included levonorgestrel (LNG) 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in doses other than 0.75 mg (4 trials), and hormones other than LNG (7 trials). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, discontinuation, side effects, and acceptability. Pericoital levonorgestrel was reasonably efficacious and safe. The pooled Pearl Index for the 0.75 mg dose of LNG was 5.4 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.1 to 7.0). The pooled Pearl Index for all doses of LNG was 5.0 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.4 to 5.6). Other hormonal drugs appeared promising but most of them were not studied extensively. Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effects reported. However, the studies provided no consistent evidence of a relationship between bleeding abnormalities and either frequency of pill intake or total dose of the drug. Non-menstrual side effects were reportedly mild and not tabulated in most studies. Most women liked the pericoital method in spite of frequent menstrual irregularities. The studies of pericoital LNG regimens provided promising results but many had serious methodological issues. Most reports were decades old and provided limited information. However, we considered the evidence to be moderate quality because of the large number of participants from diverse populations, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results across studies. Rigorous research is still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pericoital use of LNG as a primary means of contraception among women with infrequent intercourse. If the method is shown to be efficacious, safe and acceptable, the results may warrant revision of the current World Health Organization recommendations and marketing strategies.","We ran computer searches until 1 September 2014 to find relevant studies in any language. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers to find other trials. We assessed the quality of the research methods in the studies. We used the Pearl Index to estimate the effect. The Pearl Index is the number of pregnancies for every 100 years of pill use. We found 22 studies from the past 40 years. They included a total of 12,400 women in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Fifteen trials studied different doses of the hormone levonorgestrel and seven looked at other hormones. These studies showed that using some hormones right before or after sex did prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel seemed to work well, and was safe and accepted by thousands of women in several large trials. The most common side effects were menstrual bleeding problems. However, such bleeding issues were not always related to how often women took the pills or the total dose of the drug. Most studies were old and many reports were not complete. However, the data had moderate quality because of the many women in these studies, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results. We do not know for sure whether using levonorgestrel repeatedly around the time of sex is a good and safe method of birth control. More high-quality research is needed to answer the question."
CD009716,"We included 15 RCTs with a total of 17,091 participants. Compared with fewer antiplatelet agents, multiple antiplatelet agents were associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke recurrence (5.78% versus 7.84%, risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.82; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) with no significant difference in vascular death (0.60% versus 0.66%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.45; P = 0.94; moderate-certainty evidence). There was a higher risk of intracranial haemorrhage (0.42% versus 0.21%, RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.50; P = 0.03; low-certainty evidence) and extracranial haemorrhage (6.38% versus 2.81%, RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.70; P < 0.001; high-certainty evidence) with multiple antiplatelet agents. On secondary analysis of dual versus single antiplatelet agent therapy, benefit for stroke recurrence (5.73% versus 8.06%, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) was maintained as well as risk of extracranial haemorrhage (1.24% versus 0.40%, RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.74 to 5.46; P < 0.001; high-certainty evidence). The composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death (6.37% versus 8.77%, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) and ischaemic stroke (6.30% versus 8.94%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.81; P < 0.001; high-certainty evidence) were significantly in favour of dual antiplatelet therapy, whilst the risk of intracranial haemorrhage became less significant (0.34% versus 0.21%, RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.06; P = 0.23; low-certainty evidence). Multiple antiplatelet agents are more effective in reducing stroke recurrence but increase the risk of haemorrhage compared to one antiplatelet agent. The benefit in reduction of stroke recurrence seems to outweigh the harm for dual antiplatelet agents initiated in the acute setting and continued for one month. Further studies are required in different populations to establish comprehensive safety profiles and long-term outcomes to establish duration of therapy.","We compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet drugs early after stroke. The evidence is current to 6 July 2020. We included 15 clinical trials with a total of 17,091 participants from a range of Asian, European and North American populations. The most common antiplatelet combinations tested were aspirin and dipyridamole, and aspirin and clopidogrel. We found that multiple antiplatelet drugs reduced the risk of stroke recurrence but increased the risk of bleeding compared with fewer antiplatelet drugs. Two antiplatelet drugs appear to be more effective in preventing early stroke recurrence than a single antiplatelet drug, but there is an increased risk of side effects, especially bleeding. The benefits of dual antiplatelet drugs started immediately after a stroke seems to outweigh the risks for the first month. The certainty of evidence was generally moderate or high."
CD002748,"All 61 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer, who underwent RRM. Twenty-one BRRM studies looking at the incidence of breast cancer or disease-specific mortality, or both, reported reductions after BRRM, particularly for those women with BRCA1/2 mutations. Twenty-six CRRM studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Seven studies attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and showed no overall survival advantage for CRRM. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CRRM, but after adjusting for bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BRRSO), the CRRM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant. Twenty studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have RRM but greater variation in satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BRRM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BRRM, but there was diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings. Seventeen case series reporting on adverse events from RRM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated reoperations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 64% in participants with reconstruction. In women who have had cancer in one breast, removing the other breast may reduce the incidence of cancer in that other breast, but there is insufficient evidence that this improves survival because of the continuing risk of recurrence or metastases from the original cancer. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention, when considering RRM. While published observational studies demonstrated that BRRM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies are suggested. BRRM should be considered only among those at high risk of disease, for example, BRCA1/2 carriers. CRRM was shown to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer, but there is insufficient evidence that CRRM improves survival, and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are recommended. It is possible that selection bias in terms of healthier, younger women being recommended for or choosing CRRM produces better overall survival numbers for CRRM. Given the number of women who may be over-treated with BRRM/CRRM, it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention when considering RRM.","Sixty-one studies presented data on 15,077 women with a wide range of risk factors for developing breast cancer, who underwent RRM. Risk-reducing mastectomy could include either surgically removing both breasts to prevent breast cancer (bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy or BRRM), or removing the disease-free breast in women who have had breast cancer in one breast to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in the other breast (contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy or CRRM). The evidence is current to July 2016. The BRRM studies reported that it reduced the incidence of breast cancer or the number of deaths or both, but many of the studies have methodological limitations. After BRRM, most women are satisfied with their decision, but reported less satisfaction with cosmetic results, body image, and sexual feelings. One of the complications of RRM was the need for additional unanticipated surgeries, particularly in women undergoing reconstruction after RRM. However, most women also experienced reduced worry of developing and dying from breast cancer along with diminished satisfaction with body image and sexual feelings
In women who have had cancer in one breast, removing the other breast (CRRM) may reduce the incidence of cancer in that other breast, but there is insufficient evidence that this improves survival because of the continuing risk of recurrence or metastases from the original cancer. While published observational studies demonstrated that BRRM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies are suggested. BRRM should be considered only among those at high risk of disease, for example, carriers of mutations in the breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. CRRM was shown to reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), but there is insufficient evidence that CRRM improves survival, and studies that control for multiple variables that can affect results are recommended. It is possible that selection bias in terms of healthier, younger women being recommended for or choosing CRRM produces better overall survival numbers for CRRM. Just over half of the studies were found to have a low risk of selection bias, that is, studies adjusting for systematic differences in prognosis or treatment responsiveness between the groups, and similarly, 60% had a low risk of detection bias, that is, studies considered systematic differences in the ways the outcomes were measured and detected. The primary cause for both selection bias and detection bias was not controlling for all major confounding factors, e.g., risk factors or having bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BRRSO - surgery to remove fallopian tubes and ovaries) in the subject and control groups. Performance bias (validation of the risk-reducing mastectomy) was not problematic, as most studies were based on surgical reports; three relied on self-reports and eight were unclear because of multiple sources of data and/or broad timeframe. Attrition bias was at high risk or unclear in approximately 13% of the studies. The mean or median follow-up period reported was from 1 - 22 years. Given the number of women who may be over-treated with BRRM/CRRM, it is critical that women and clinicians understand the true risk for each individual woman before considering surgery. Additionally, thought should be given to other options to reduce breast cancer risk, such as BRRSO and chemoprevention, when considering RRM."
CD013183,"We identified 51 trials with 22,509 participants. Most recruited adults from the community using media or local advertising. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked an average of 23 cigarettes a day. We judged 18 of the studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to the five studies at low or to the 28 studies at unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results. We identified very low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision, comparing the effect of reduction-to-quit interventions with no treatment on cessation rates (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.38; I2 = 45%; 6 studies, 1599 participants). However, when comparing reduction-to-quit interventions with abrupt quitting (standard care) we found evidence that neither approach resulted in superior quit rates (RR 1. 01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.17; I2 = 29%; 22 studies, 9219 participants). We judged this estimate to be of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Subgroup analysis provided some evidence (P = 0.01, I2 = 77%) that reduction-to-quit interventions may result in more favourable quit rates than abrupt quitting if varenicline is used as a reduction aid. Our analysis comparing reduction using pharmacotherapy with reduction alone found low-certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency and imprecision, that reduction aided by pharmacotherapy resulted in higher quit rates (RR 1. 68, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.58; I2 = 78%; 11 studies, 8636 participants). However, a significant subgroup analysis (P < 0.001, I2 = 80% for subgroup differences) suggests that this may only be true when fast-acting NRT or varenicline are used (both moderate-certainty evidence) and not when nicotine patch, combination NRT or bupropion are used as an aid (all low- or very low-quality evidence). More evidence is likely to change the interpretation of the latter effects. Although there was some evidence from within-study comparisons that behavioural support for reduction to quit resulted in higher quit rates than self-help resources alone, the relative efficacy of various other characteristics of reduction-to-quit interventions investigated through within- and between-study comparisons did not provide any evidence that they enhanced the success of reduction-to-quit interventions. Pre-quit AEs, SAEs and nicotine withdrawal symptoms were measured variably and infrequently across studies. There was some evidence that AEs occurred more frequently in studies that compared reduction using pharmacotherapy versus no pharmacotherapy; however, the AEs reported were mild and usual symptoms associated with NRT use. There was no clear evidence that the number of people reporting SAEs, or changes in withdrawal symptoms, differed between trial arms. There is moderate-certainty evidence that neither reduction-to-quit nor abrupt quitting interventions result in superior long-term quit rates when compared with one another. Evidence comparing the efficacy of reduction-to-quit interventions with no treatment was inconclusive and of low certainty. There is also low-certainty evidence to suggest that reduction-to-quit interventions may be more effective when pharmacotherapy is used as an aid, particularly fast-acting NRT or varenicline (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence for any adverse effects of reduction-to-quit interventions was sparse, but available data suggested no excess of pre-quit SAEs or withdrawal symptoms. We downgraded the evidence across comparisons due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. Future research should aim to match any additional components of multicomponent reduction-to-quit interventions across study arms, so that the effect of reduction can be isolated. In particular, well-conducted, adequately-powered studies should focus on investigating the most effective features of reduction-to-quit interventions to maximise cessation rates.","This review includes 51 studies of over 22,000 people who smoked tobacco. Most were adults, and people typically smoked at least 23 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. All studies included at least one group of people who were asked to cut down their smoking and then quit tobacco smoking altogether. This group was compared to either a group who did not receive any treatment to stop smoking, a group who were asked to stop smoking all at once, or a group who were also asked to cut down their smoking in a different way. We did not include studies which asked people to cut down without quitting. Studies lasted for at least six months. The evidence is up to date to October 2018. There was not enough information available to decide whether cutting down before quitting helped more people to stop smoking than no stop-smoking treatment. However, people who were asked to stop smoking all of their cigarettes at once were not more likely to quit than people who were asked to cut down their smoking before quitting. This suggests that asking people to cut down their smoking first may be a useful way to help people to stop smoking. People who cut down their smoking while using varenicline or a fast-acting form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as gum or lozenge, may be more likely to quit smoking than people who cut down their smoking without using a medicine to help them. Giving people face-to-face support to cut down their smoking may help more people to quit than if they are provided with self-help materials to cut down by themselves. There was not enough information available to decide whether other features of the cutting-down-to-quit intervention improved people's chances of stopping smoking. We looked at whether being asked to cut down smoking before quitting resulted in negative effects, such as cigarette cravings, difficulty sleeping, low mood or irritability. Most studies did not provide information about this; more studies are therefore needed to answer this question. There is very low-quality evidence looking at whether cutting down smoking before quitting helps more people to quit smoking than no treatment. We rated the quality as very low, as there were problems with the design of studies, findings of studies were very different from one another, and not enough people took part, making it difficult to tell whether cutting down helps people to quit smoking. However, there is moderate-certainty evidence that cutting down before quitting may result in similar quit rates to quitting all at once, which suggests that cutting down may be a helpful approach. We rated this evidence as moderate because there is a chance that future studies may find that cutting down helps slightly more or slightly fewer people to quit than when people quit all at once. There is also moderate-quality evidence that people may be more likely to quit by cutting down first when they use a stop-smoking medicine like varenicline or a type of fast-acting NRT to help them. We rated this evidence as moderate certainty because there were not enough people taking part; more studies are needed."
CD009823,"We included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high-income countries (HICs). At update stage (from our 2015 search), one previously included study was removed and three new studies added (since our 2012 search). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop-in and shelter-based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects.We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours . Interventions evaluated consisted of time-limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. Analysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop-in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street-connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street-connected children and young people with different backgrounds and service needs.","Thirteen studies have rigorously evaluated 19 interventions such as services to support street-connected children and youth - all in high-income countries. Most have compared therapy-based services versus usual shelter and drop-in services, or versus other therapeutic/health interventions. We found mixed results among these studies but overall findings suggesting that participants receiving therapy and those provided usual services benefited to a similar level. Future research should consider the benefits of usual drop-in and shelter services, most particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and should focus on street-connected children and young people. None of the studies included participants comparable with street children in low-income countries, who may be on the street primarily to earn a living, or as a result of war, migration or urbanisation. Overall we assessed the quality of the evidence included in this review as low/moderate."
CD001169,"Amantadine prevented 25% of ILI cases (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 36%), and 61% of influenza A cases (95% CI 35% to 76%). Amantadine reduced duration of fever by one day (95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). Rimantadine demonstrated comparable effectiveness, but there were fewer trials and the results for prophylaxis were not statistically significant. Both amantadine and rimantadine induced significant gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. Adverse effects of the central nervous system and study withdrawals were significantly more common with amantadine than rimantadine. Neither drug affected the rate of viral shedding from the nose or the course of asymptomatic influenza. Amantadine and rimantadine have comparable efficacy and effectiveness in relieving or treating symptoms of influenza A in healthy adults, although rimantadine induces fewer adverse effects than amantadine. The effectiveness of both drugs in interrupting transmission is probably low. Resistance of influenza viruses to amantadine is a serious worldwide problem as shown by recent virological surveillances. Both drugs have adverse gastrointestinal (stomach and gut) effects, but amantadine can also have serious effects on the nervous system. They should only be used in an emergency when all other measures fail.","The flu can be caused by many different viruses. One type is influenza A, with headaches, coughs and runny noses that can last for many days and lead to serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Amantadine and rimantadine are antiviral drugs. The review of trials found that both drugs are similarly helpful in relieving the symptoms of influenza A in adults, but only when there is a high probability that the cause of the flu is influenza A (a known epidemic, for example). It is likely that neither drug will interrupt the spread of influenza A and by treating symptoms may encourage viral spread in the community by people who are feeling better but are still infectious. Resistance of influenza viruses to amantadine is a serious worldwide problem as shown by recent surveys. Both drugs have adverse gastrointestinal (stomach and gut) effects, but amantadine can also have serious effects on the nervous system. They should only be used in an emergency when all other measures fail."
CD008898,"Four trials including a total of 1447 young offenders were included in the review.

There is currently a lack of high quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of restorative justice conferencing for young offenders. Caution is urged in interpreting the results of this review considering the small number of included studies, subsequent low power and high risk of bias. The effects may potentially be more evident for victims than offenders. The need for further research in this area is highlighted.",The purpose of this review was to look at whether young people who are part of a restorative justice conference are less likely to reoffend than those who go through normal court proceedings. Four randomised controlled trials were included in this review. Findings indicate that there was no difference between those who are part of restorative justice conferences and those in normal court proceedings in terms of the rate of reoffending after the intervention. There was also no difference between these two groups in terms of a change in their self-esteem or their satisfaction with the process. Results may indicate that victims who are part of a restorative conference are more satisfied than those who are part of court proceedings. The quality of the included studies was low. More high quality research using a design where participants are randomly allocated to an intervention or control group is needed.
CD003326,"Thirteen studies were included in this review. Eleven studies compared a tissue adhesive with standard wound closure. No significant difference was found for cosmesis at any time point examined, using either Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) or Wound Evaluation Score (WES). Pain scores (Parent VAS weighted mean difference (WMD) -13.4 mm; 95% CI -20.0 to -6.9) and procedure time (WMD -4.7 minutes; 95% CI -7.2 to -2.1) significantly favoured tissue adhesives. Only one study reported on ease of use, favouring standard wound closure. Small but statistically significant risk differences were found for dehiscence (favouring standard wound care, Number Needed to Harm (NNH) 40; 95% CI 20 to 1168) and erythema (favouring tissue adhesive, NNH 10; 95% CI 5 to 239). Other complications were not significantly different between treatment groups. Two studies compared tissue adhesives. One study compared two different tissue adhesives, butylcyanoacrylate with octylcyanoacrylate, for pediatric facial lacerations and found no significant difference for cosmesis, pain, procedure time, or complications. Another study compared two different formulations (viscosities) of octylcyanoacrylate to assess the incidence of product migration as a proxy for complications of application; the high-viscosity product migrated on significantly fewer participants. Tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. They offer the benefit of decreased procedure time and less pain, when compared to standard wound closure. A small but statistically significant increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives is observed.","The review found that glue is an excellent substitute for stitches, staples or tapes to close simple cuts. Glue causes less pain, is quicker and needs no follow up for removal. A slightly higher number of cuts may break open (dehisce) after being glued, compared to cuts closed with stitches, staples or tapes. Though there are a few different types of glue available, no one glue seems to be superior."
CD007156,"We included 30 RCTs (2176 participants) in this updated review. We assessed one study at low risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias and 24 studies at high risk of bias. We found diverse interventions, which we categorised according to putative mechanism of action. We present below our main findings for the comparison 'any intervention compared with placebo or no active treatment' (though most trials included habit cessation for all participants). Results for head-to-head comparisons of active interventions are presented in full in the main review. Any intervention versus placebo or no active treatment
Participant-reported resumption of normal eating, chewing and speech
No studies reported this outcome. Interincisal distance
Antioxidants may increase mouth opening (indicated by interincisal distance (mm)) when measured at less than three months (mean difference (MD) 3.11 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 5.77; 2 studies, 520 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably increase mouth opening slightly at three to six months (MD 8.83 mm, 95% CI 8.22 to 9.45; 3 studies, 620 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Antioxidants may make no difference to interincisal distance at six-month follow-up or greater (MD −1.41 mm, 95% CI −5.74 to 2.92; 1 study, 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly (MD 1.80 mm, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.58; 1 study, 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, it should be noted that these results are all less than 10 mm, which could be considered the minimal change that is meaningful to someone with oral submucous fibrosis. The evidence was very uncertain for all other interventions compared to placebo or no active treatment (intralesional dexamethasone injections, pentoxifylline, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase, physiotherapy). Burning sensation
Antioxidants probably reduce burning sensation visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at less than three months (MD −30.92 mm, 95% CI −31.57 to −30.27; 1 study, 400 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), at three to six months (MD −70.82 mm, 95% CI −94.39 to −47.25; 2 studies, 500 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and at more than six months (MD −27.60 mm, 95% CI −36.21 to −18.99; 1 study, 90 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain for the other interventions that were compared to placebo and measured burning sensation (intralesional dexamethasone, vasodilators). Adverse effects
Fifteen studies reported adverse effects as an outcome. Six of these studies found no adverse effects. One study evaluating abdominal dermal fat graft reported serious adverse effects resulting in prolonged hospital stay for 3/30 participants. There were mild and transient general adverse effects to systemic drugs, such as dyspepsia, abdominal pain and bloating, gastritis and nausea, in studies evaluating vasodilators and antioxidants in particular. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants administered systemically probably improve mouth opening slightly at three to six months and improve burning sensation VAS scores up to and beyond six months. We found only low/very low-certainty evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to make an informed judgement about potential adverse effects associated with any of these treatments. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of the other interventions tested. High-quality, adequately powered intervention trials with a low risk of bias that compare biologically plausible treatments for OSF are needed. It is important that relevant participant-reported outcomes are evaluated.","We found 30 relevant trials. Most trials looked at different treatments that each worked differently. Many trials compared different types of treatments with each other. We decided that trials comparing one treatment against no active treatment were most important because we do not know which, if any, treatments actually work. The results told us that antioxidant medicines (which scavenge and neutralise unstable particles that are naturally formed during metabolism or by exposure to environmental toxins) taken by mouth may improve mouth opening slightly for up to six months after treatment, but we are not sure that this lasts longer than six months. Antioxidants may also reduce burning sensation in the mouth for more than six months after treatment and we think this might be an important improvement for people with oral submucous fibrosis. The evidence for other treatments that we looked at was very uncertain. Only half of the trials reported side effects or other potentially harmful effects of the treatments, so it is difficult to say confidently how safe any of the treatments might be. We are moderately confident that antioxidants help in the treatment of oral submucous fibrosis, but have little confidence in the other evidence because many trials had design limitations. We searched for trials up to 5 September 2022."
CD013379,"We included 11 studies (1931 participants) conducted in intensive care units (ICUs). Eight evaluated non-vocal communication aids and three voice-enabling aids. Usual care was the comparator for all. For six studies, this comprised no aid; usual care in the remaining five studies comprised use of various communication aids. Overall, our confidence in results regarding effectiveness of communication interventions was very low due to imprecision, measurement heterogeneity, inconsistency in results, and most studies at high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. No non-vocal aid studies reported our primary outcome. We are uncertain of the effects of early use of a voice-enabling aid compared to routine use on ability to phonate at least one intelligible word (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 50.08; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Compared to usual care without aids, we are uncertain about effects of a non-vocal aid (communication board) on patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.33; 4 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No studies of non-vocal aids reported quality of life. Low-certainty evidence from two studies suggests early use of a voice-enabling aid may have no effect on quality of life (MD 2.27, 95% CI –7.21 to 11.75). Conceptual differences in measures of psychological distress precluded data pooling; however, intervention arm participants reported less distress suggesting there might be benefit, but our certainty in the evidence is very low. Low-certainty evidence suggest voice-enabling aids have little or no effect on ICU length of stay; we were unable to determine effects of non-vocal aids. Three studies reported different adverse events (physical restraint use, bleeding following tracheostomy, and respiratory parameters indicating respiratory decompensation). Adverse event rates were similar between arms in all three studies. However, uncertainty remains as to any harm associated with communication aids. Due to a lack of high-quality studies, imprecision, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity,  the evidence provides insufficient information to guide practice as to which communication aid is more appropriate and when to use them. Understanding effectiveness of communication aids would benefit from development of a core outcome measurement set.","We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long-term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low-quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well-being and people's ability to communicate."
CD006318,"We found four trials with 271 pregnant women. Three compared methadone with buprenorphine and one methadone with oral slow-release morphine. Three out of four studies had adequate allocation concealment and were double-blind. The major flaw in the included studies was attrition bias: three out of four had a high dropout rate (30% to 40%), and this was unbalanced between groups. Methadone versus buprenorphine:
There was probably no evidence of a difference in the dropout rate from treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.20, three studies, 223 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference in the use of primary substances between methadone and buprenorphine (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.68, two studies, 151 participants, low-quality evidence). Birth weight may be higher in the buprenorphine group in the two trials that reported data MD;-530.00 g, 95%CI -662.78 to -397.22 (one study, 19 particpants) and MD: -215.00 g, 95%CI -238.93 to -191.07 (one study, 131 participants) although the results could not be pooled due to very high heterogeneity (very low-quality of evidence). The third study reported that there was no evidence of a difference. We found there may be no evidence of a difference in the APGAR score (MD: 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03, two studies,163 participants, low-quality evidence). Many measures were used in the studies to assess neonatal abstinence syndrome. The number of newborns treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is the most critical outcome, may not differ between groups (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to1.63, three studies, 166 participants, low-quality evidence). Only one study which compared methadone with buprenorphine reported side effects. We found there may be no evidence of a difference in the number of mothers with serious adverse events (AEs) (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.83, 175 participants, low-quality evidence) and we found there may be no difference in the numbers of newborns with serious AEs (RR 4.77, 95% CI 0.59, 38.49,131 participants, low-quality evidence). Methadone versus slow-release morphine:
There were no dropouts in either treatment group. Oral slow-release morphine may be superior to methadone for abstinence from heroin use during pregnancy (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.77, one study, 48 participants, low-quality evidence). In the comparison between methadone and slow-release morphine, no side effects were reported for the mother. In contrast, one child in the methadone group had central apnoea, and one child in the morphine group had obstructive apnoea (low-quality evidence). Methadone and buprenorphine may be similar in efficacy and safety for the treatment of opioid-dependent pregnant women and their babies. There is not enough evidence to make conclusions for the comparison between methadone and slow-release morphine. Overall, the body of evidence is too small to make firm conclusions about the equivalence of the treatments compared. There is still a need for randomised controlled trials of adequate sample size comparing different maintenance treatments.","Only four randomised controlled trials with 271 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review: two from Austria (outpatients), one from the USA (inpatients) and the fourth a multicentre, international study conducted in Austria, Canada and the USA. The trials continued for 15 to 18 weeks. Three compared methadone with buprenorphine (223 participants) and one compared methadone with oral slow-release morphine (48 participants). The National Institute on Drug Abuse funded two studies, one received a grant from the Mayor of Vienna, and in the fourth study Schering Plough provided an educational grant to the first author to employ personnel required to conduct this study. This review found few differences in newborn or maternal outcomes for pregnant, opiate-addicted women who were maintained on methadone, buprenorphine or oral slow-release morphine from a mean gestational age of 23 weeks to delivery. Comparing methadone with buprenorphine, there is probably little or no difference in the number of women who dropped out of treatment. There may be little or no difference in the use of a primary substance and the number of newborns treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome between the methadone and buprenorphine groups. We are very uncertain whether newborns with mothers receiving buprenorphine could have a heavier birth weight. Comparing methadone with oral slow-release morphine, there were no dropouts in the only study included. The use of heroin in the third trimester may be lower with slow-release morphine. However, there may be little or no difference in infant birth weight or duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome. The number of participants in the trials was small and may not be sufficient to draw firm conclusions. All the included studies ended immediately after the baby was born. No severe complications were noted. In the comparison of methadone with buprenorphine, the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low because of inconsistency in the results of the studies for some outcomes, high rates of participants who dropped out from the studies, and small sample sizes of the included studies. In the comparison of methadone with slow-release morphine, the quality of the evidence was low because of the small sample size of the study."
CD001890,"We identified three trials in adult dialysis patients (n = 117). There were insufficient data for most outcomes for meta-analysis. In all three trials acidosis improved in the intervention group though there was variation in achieved bicarbonate level. There was no evidence of effect on blood pressure or sodium levels. Some measures of nutritional status/protein metabolism (e.g. SGA, NP NA) were significantly improved by correction in the one trial that looked in these in detail. There was heterogeneity of the effect on serum albumin in two trials. Serum PTH fell significantly in the two trials that estimated this, with no significant effect on calcium or phosphate though both fell after correction. Complex bone markers were assessed in one study, with some evidence for a reduction in bone turnover in those with initial high bone turnover and an increase in low turnover patients. The studies were underpowered to assess clinical outcomes, in the one study that did there was some evidence for a reduction in hospitalisation after correction. The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide robust evidence.",This review found three small trials in adult haemodialysis patients (n = 117). The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients and none in children. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide strong evidence.
CD005483,"Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Two hundred ninety-four individuals randomized to anabolic steroid therapy and 238 individuals randomized to placebo were included in the analysis of efficacy for change from baseline in lean body mass. Three hundred forty-three individuals randomized to anabolic steroid and 286 randomized to placebo were included in the analysis of efficacy for change from baseline in body weight. The mean methodologic quality of the included studies was 4.1, of a maximum 5 points. Although significant heterogeneity was present for both outcomes, the average change in lean body mass was 1.3 kg (95% CI: 0.6, 2.0), while the average change in total body weight was 1.1 kg (95% CI: 0.3, 2.0). A total of eight deaths occurred during the treatment period; four in the anabolic steroid treatment groups and four in the placebo-treatment groups (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.03, 0.03). The risk difference for withdrawals or discontinuations of study medication due to adverse events was 0.00 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.03). Although the results of the trials were heterogeneous, on average, the administration of anabolic steroids appeared to result in a small increase in both lean body mass and body weight as compared with placebo. While these results suggest that anabolic steroids may be useful in the treatment of weight loss in HIV infected individuals, due to limitations, treatment recommendations cannot be made. Further information is required regarding the long-term benefit and adverse effects of anabolic steroid use, the specific populations for which anabolic steroid therapy may be most beneficial, and the optimal regime. In addition, the correlation of improvement in lean body mass with more clinically relevant endpoints, such as physical functioning and survival, needs to be determined.","The purpose of this review was to evaluate anabolic steroids as a means of treatment of weight loss in individuals with HIV infection. The review includes 13 randomized clinical trials in the primary analysis. The results suggested that anabolic steroids increased both lean body mass and body weight. However, the results were not consistent among individual trials and the average increase was small and may not be clinically relevant. Furthermore, the results need to be interpreted with caution as this meta-analysis was limited due to small sample sizes; short duration of treatment and of follow-up; and heterogeneity of the study populations, the anabolic interventions, and concomitant therapies."
CD004844,"A total of 770 participants were involved in the 11 included studies. Data from five included randomised double-blind studies showed beneficial effects of antipsychotics in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Quantitative analysis of these studies showed a significant reduction of mean pain intensity after administration of the antipsychotic compared to placebo or another active compound, weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.78 (95% CI -2.71 to -0.85) for the continuous data; and relative risk (RR) 0.43 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.73), number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) 2.6 for the dichotomous data. Nevertheless, the test for heterogeneity was significant for both the continuous data (P = 0.0007) and the dichotomous data (P = 0.04). Obviously this makes the calculated NNT less reliable and caution is warranted when interpreting these results. The most frequently reported adverse effects were extrapyramidal (that is involuntary movements, parkinsonism and akathisia) and sedating effects. The recent search found five new studies which were all excluded, so the review remains the same as previously. Antipsychotics might be used as an add-on therapy in the treatment of painful conditions. Nevertheless, extrapyramidal and sedating side effects have to be considered before using antipsychotics for treating painful conditions. Results for antipsychotics in the treatment of different painful conditions are mixed and most sample sizes in the reviewed RCTs are small. Further studies on atypical antipsychotics in larger double-blind placebo-controlled studies that include standardised pain assessment and documentation are warranted.","The review authors assessed the effect of these medicines on pain and their side effects. Based on 5 out of 11 included trials there were some beneficial effects of antipsychotics in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Analysis of these studies showed a significant reduction in pain after administration of the antipsychotic compared to placebo or another medicine, however these results were based on small studies and therefore they may be unreliable. It is also important to consider the unwanted effects that these medicines might cause."
CD006006,"We included 11 randomised clinical trials with 771 adult liver transplant recipients (mean age 47.31 years, male 61.48%), of whom 378 people were randomised to receive prostaglandins and 393 people were randomised to either placebo (272 participants) or standard care (121 participants). All trials were published between 1993 and 2016. Ten trials were conducted in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Prostaglandins may reduce all-cause mortality up to one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.23; risk difference (RD) 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 63 fewer to 36 more; 11 trials, 771 participants; low-certainty evidence). Prostaglandins may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40; RD 81 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 148 fewer to 18 more; 6 trials, 568 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported health-related quality of life. Prostaglandins may result in little to no difference in liver retransplantation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.96; RD 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 33 fewer to 62 more; 6 trials, 468 participants; low-certainty evidence); early allograft dysfunction (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.18; RD 137 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 241 fewer to 47 more; 1 trial, 99 participants; low-certainty evidence); primary non-function of the allograft (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.32; RD 23 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 40 fewer to 16 more; 7 trials, 624 participants; low-certainty evidence); and length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) −1.15 days, 95% CI −5.44 to 3.14; 4 trials, 369 participants; low-certainty evidence). Prostaglandins may result in a large reduction in the development of acute kidney failure requiring dialysis (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.73; RD 100 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 132 fewer to 49 fewer; 5 trials, 477 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of prostaglandins on adverse events considered non-serious (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.36; RD 225 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 294 fewer to 65 fewer; 4 trials, 329 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported receiving funding; one of these was with vested interests. We found one registered ongoing trial. Eleven trials evaluated prostaglandins in adult liver transplanted recipients. Based on low-certainty evidence, prostaglandins may reduce all-cause mortality up to one month; may cause little to no difference in serious adverse events, liver retransplantation, early allograft dysfunction, primary non-function of the allograft, and length of hospital stay; and may have a large reduction in the development of acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. We do not know the effect of prostaglandins on adverse events considered non-serious. We lack adequately powered, high-quality trials evaluating the effects of prostaglandins for people undergoing liver transplantation.","We wanted to know if prostaglandins are a useful treatment after liver transplantation and if they caused any side effects when compared to placebo or usual care. We looked at the following outcomes: deaths from any cause up to one month after treatment; any side effects; effects on quality of life; whether the need for retransplantation was decreased; whether initial poor or non-function of the liver was decreased; whether early kidney injury needing dialysis was decreased; and whether length of hospital stay was decreased. We searched for studies on prostaglandins used to treat adults who had received a liver transplant compared with placebo or standard care. Participants could be of any sex or ethnicity. We compared the results of the studies and rated them, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 11 studies with 771 participants. Of these, 378 participants were given prostaglandins. Apart from one study, all other studies took place in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Death from any cause
Prostaglandins may reduce death from any cause (11 studies, 771 people). In 1000 people, we may expect that 21 fewer people would die with prostaglandins compared with standard care or placebo. Did people get better with prostaglandins? – Prostaglandins may result in little to no difference in need for retransplantation (6 studies, 468 participants). – Prostaglandins may result in little to no difference in initial poor function of the liver (1 study, 99 participants). – Prostaglandins may result in little to no difference in initial non-function of the liver (7 studies, 624 participants). – Prostaglandins may result in a large reduction in the development of acute kidney injury needing dialysis (5 studies, 477 participants). Did people get worse with prostaglandins? We did not find any information to suggest that prostaglandins cause harm. Quality of life
None of the studies reported quality of life. Unwanted effects
We found no information to suggest that prostaglandins cause harm. Our evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find studies for some of our outcomes of interest. In addition, our confidence in the evidence was low for all outcomes except for serious adverse events considered non-serious, for which our confidence in the evidence was very low. Low and very low confidence in the evidence means that the obtained results are uncertain, and when further studies are performed and data are added, results will change further. This evidence is current to 27 December 2022."
CD008319,"Five trials with 183 participants are included in the review. Two trials (77 participants) compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone and three trials (106 participants) compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone. Trials were heterogenous in design and two were only available in abstract form. Risk of bias was difficult to assess in most trials but, for four out of five trials, we judged there to be a high risk from lack of blinding and an unclear risk with regards to randomisation. Results were not fully reported and only limited data were available for analysis. One trial was a cross-over design and we only included data from the first intervention arm. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone
Only one trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle (quality of life) in both groups (very low-certainty evidence). Neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but there was no difference reported between treatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). With regards to our secondary outcomes, one trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the time to next exacerbation. In neither case was a difference between treatments identified (both very low-certainty evidence). The single trial (18 participants) measuring adverse events and sputum microbiology did not observe any in either treatment group for either outcome (very low-certainty  evidence). Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone
Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics may make little or no difference to quality of life compared to intravenous antibiotics alone. None of the trials reported time off work or school. All three trials measured lung function, but found no difference between groups in forced expiratory volume in one second (two trials; 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or vital capacity (one trial; 62 participants). None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics. Inhaled plus intravenous antibiotics may make little difference to the time to next exacerbation; however, one trial (28 participants) reported on hospital admissions and found no difference between groups. There is likely no difference between groups in adverse events (very low-certainty evidence) and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (very low-certainty evidence). We identified only low- or very low-certainty evidence to judge the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis. The included trials were not sufficiently powered to achieve their goals. Hence, we are unable to demonstrate whether one treatment was superior to the other or not. Further research is needed to establish whether inhaled tobramycin may be used as an alternative to intravenous tobramycin for some pulmonary exacerbations.","We found five trials comparing different ways of giving antibiotics when treating exacerbations in a total of 183 people with cystic fibrosis. Two trials compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenous antibiotics alone (77 participants) and three trials compared a combination of inhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone (106 participants). In all trials, the inhaled antibiotics were compared to the same antibiotics given intravenously. The numbers of participants in each trial ranged from 16 to 62. Inhaled antibiotics alone versus intravenous antibiotics alone
One trial (18 participants) reported a perceived improvement in lifestyle in both groups, but neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but neither reported any difference between treatment groups. One trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need for additional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on the length of time until the next exacerbation - there was no difference between inhaled or intravenous antibiotics for either outcome. Only one trial (18 participants) measured adverse events and sputum microbiology, but did not find any difference between treatments for either outcome. Inhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics alone
One trial found that there is likely no difference in quality of life between treatments. All of the trials reported lung function, but found no difference between groups. One trial showed there to be little or no difference in the time until the next exacerbation. None of the trials reported on the need for additional antibiotics; however, one trial (28 participants) found no difference in the number of hospital admissions between groups. There may be no difference between groups in adverse events and one trial (62 participants) reported no difference in the appearance of antibiotic-resistant organisms. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low or low. We had concerns since only one trial stated how the participants were diagnosed with CF or how they defined an exacerbation. It was not possible to keep secret which treatment the participants were receiving, as the trials compared different ways of giving the antibiotics; we thought this would likely influence some of the results. We were not sure whether the participants were put into the different groups truly at random and we do not know how this might have affected the results."
CD008918,"We included 28 small, low quality studies (29 reports) involving 2564 participants. Of 20 studies (21 reports) comparing morphine with placebo, nine studies with adequate data were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the risk of bias was unclear. Overall, the quality of the evidence assessed using GRADE was low to very low, downgraded primarily due to risk of bias, small study size, and imprecision. No statistical difference was found between 1 mg IA morphine and placebo in pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS)) at early phase (zero to two hours) (mean difference (MD) -0.50, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.14; participants = 297; studies = 7; low quality evidence), medium phase (two to six hours) (MD -0.47, 95% CI -1.09 to 0.14; participants = 297; studies = 7; low quality evidence) and late phase (six to 30 hours) (MD -0.88, 95% CI -1.81 to 0.04; participants = 297; studies = 7; low quality evidence). No significant difference was found between 1 mg and 2 mg morphine for pain intensity at early phase (MD -0.56, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.81; participants = 105; studies = 2; low quality evidence), while 4 mg/5 mg morphine provided better analgesia than 1 mg morphine at late phase (MD 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.25; participants = 97; studies = 3; low quality evidence). IA morphine was not better than local anaesthetic agents at early phase (MD 1.43, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.37; participants = 248; studies = 5; low quality evidence), NSAIDs at early phase (MD 0.95, 95% CI -0.95 to 2.85; participants = 80; studies = 2; very low quality evidence), sufentanil, fentanyl or pethidine for pain intensity. IA morphine was similar to intramuscular (IM) morphine for pain intensity at early phase (MD 0.21, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.90; participants = 72; studies = 2; very low quality evidence). Meta-analysis indicated that there was no difference between IA morphine and placebo or bupivacaine in time to first analgesic request. Eleven out of 20 studies comparing morphine with placebo reported adverse events and no statistical difference was obtained regarding the incidence of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.36; participants = 314; studies = 8; low quality evidence). Seven of 28 studies reported participants' withdrawal. There were not enough data for withdrawals to be able to perform meta-analysis. We have not found high quality evidence that 1 mg IA morphine is better than placebo at reducing pain intensity at early, medium or late phases. No statistical difference was reported between IA morphine and placebo regarding the incidence of adverse events. The relative effects of 1 mg morphine when compared with IA bupivacaine, NSAIDs, sufentanil, fentanyl and pethidine are uncertain. The quality of the evidence is limited by high risk of bias and small size of the included studies, which might bias the results. More high quality studies are needed to get more conclusive results.","In May 2015, this review identified 28 small, low quality studies involving 2564 participants looking at intra-articular morphine for pain relief after knee arthroscopy. From 9/20 studies we did not find evidence that intra-articular morphine given at a dose of 1 mg was better than placebo for pain relief. From the limited evidence available we were unable to determine how intra-articular morphine compared with morphine injected into the muscle (intra-muscular morphine). There was also low quality evidence for the effects of 1 mg intra-articular morphine compared with intra-articular bupivacaine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sufentanil, fentanyl and pethidine, so we were unsure which worked best. We were unable to determine how similar the rates of side effects such as nausea and vomiting were between intra-articular morphine and placebo. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. Future research should focus on finding effective analgesics for knee arthroscopy."
CD002173,"Of 3500 titles retrieved from the literature, 24 papers reporting on 23 studies could be included in the review. The studies were published between 1970 and 1997 and together included 1026 participants. Most were cross-over studies. Few studies provided sufficient information to judge the concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the percentage of symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a statistically significant difference between sodium cromoglycate and placebo. For the other pooled outcomes, most of the symptom-related outcomes and bronchodilator use showed statistically significant results, but treatment effects were small. Considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures, a clinically relevant effect of sodium cromoglycate cannot be excluded. The funnel plot showed an under-representation of small studies with negative results, suggesting publication bias. There is insufficient evidence to be sure about the efficacy of sodium cromoglycate over placebo. Publication bias is likely to have overestimated the beneficial effects of sodium cromoglycate as maintenance therapy in childhood asthma.","In this review we aimed to determine whether there is evidence for the effectiveness of inhaled sodium cromoglycate as maintenance treatment in children with chronic asthma. Most of the studies were carried out in small groups of patients. Furthermore, we suspect that not all studies undertaken have been published. The results show that there is insufficient evidence to be sure about the beneficial effect of sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo. However, for several outcome measures the results favoured sodium cromoglycate."
CD005333,"Eight studies (11 study comparisons) were identified, all of which compared cognitive and/or behavioural treatments versus treatment as usual control groups. Seven studies (ten comparisons) had usable data for meta-analyses. These studies demonstrated that patients receiving any variant of cognitive behavioural treatment exhibited significantly fewer symptoms post-treatment than those receiving treatment as usual (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.87, I² test for heterogeneity 33.4%). Different types of cognitive and/or behavioural treatments showed similar differences in effect when compared with treatment as usual. The overall treatment effect appeared to be influenced by differences in baseline severity. The findings of this review suggest that psychological treatments derived from cognitive behavioural models are an effective treatment for adult patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Larger high quality randomised controlled trials involving longer follow up periods are needed, to further test cognitive behavioural treatments, and other psychological approaches, in comparison to each other and control conditions. Future trials should examine the predictors of response to each treatment, and also conduct cost-effectiveness evaluations.","We reviewed studies that compared psychological interventions to treatment as usual groups who either received no treatment, or were on a waiting list for treatment or received usual care. We found eight studies, which together suggested that cognitive and/or behavioural treatments were better than treatment as usual conditions at reducing clinical symptoms. Baseline OCD severity and depressive symptom level predicted the degree of response. However, the conclusions were based on a small number of randomised controlled trials with small sample sizes. There were no trials of other forms of psychological treatment such as psychodynamic therapy and client-centred therapy, and a lack of available evidence for the long-term effectiveness of psychological treatments."
CD010861,"We included 22 randomised controlled trials (2858 women), most of which had high risk of bias in several domains. We performed 13 comparisons. Many comparisons are based on a small number of studies with small sample sizes. No analysis of our primary outcomes contained more than two studies. Intravenous iron was compared to oral iron in 10 studies (1553 women). Fatigue was reported in two studies and improved significantly favouring the intravenously treated group in one of the studies. Other anaemia symptoms were not reported. One woman died from cardiomyopathy (risk ratio (RR) 2.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 71.96; two studies; one event; 374 women; low quality evidence). One woman developed arrhythmia. Both cardiac complications occurred in the intravenously treated group. Allergic reactions occurred in three women treated with intravenous iron, not statistically significant (average RR 2.78; 95% CI 0.31 to 24.92; eight studies; 1454 women; I² = 0%; low quality evidence). Gastrointestinal events were less frequent in the intravenously treated group (average RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.47; eight studies; 169 events; 1307 women; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). One study evaluated red blood cell transfusion versus non-intervention. General fatigue improved significantly more in the transfusion group at three days (MD -0.80; 95% CI -1.53 to -0.07; women 388; low quality evidence), but no difference between groups was seen at six weeks. Maternal mortality was not reported. The remaining comparisons evaluated oral iron (with or without other food substances) versus placebo (three studies), intravenous iron with oral iron versus oral iron (two studies) and erythropoietin (alone or combined with iron) versus placebo or iron (seven studies). These studies did not investigate fatigue. Maternal mortality was rarely reported. The body of evidence did not allow us to reach a clear conclusion regarding the efficacy of the interventions on postpartum iron deficiency anaemia. The quality of evidence was low. Clinical outcomes were rarely reported. Laboratory values may not be reliable indicators for efficacy, as they do not always correlate with clinical treatment effects. It remains unclear which treatment modality is most effective in alleviating symptoms of postpartum anaemia. Intravenous iron was superior regarding gastrointestinal harms, however anaphylaxis and cardiac events occurred and more data are needed to establish whether this was caused by intravenous iron. The clinical significance of some temporarily improved fatigue scores in women treated with blood transfusion is uncertain and this modest effect should be balanced against known risks, e.g. maternal mortality (not reported) and maternal immunological sensitisation, which can potentially harm future pregnancies. When comparing oral iron to placebo it remains unknown whether efficacy (relief of anaemia symptoms) outweighs the documented gastrointestinal harms. We could not draw conclusions regarding erythropoietin treatment due to lack of evidence. Further research should evaluate treatment effect through clinical outcomes, i.e. presence and severity of anaemia symptoms balanced against harms, i.e. survival and severe morbidity.","We included 22 randomised controlled studies with 2858 women and performed 13 comparisons, many of which were based on few studies involving small numbers of women. The overall quality of evidence was low. Most trials were conducted in high-income countries. Ten studies, including 1553 women, compared intravenous iron with oral iron. Only one study showed a temporary positive effect on fatigue for intravenous iron. Other anaemia symptoms were not reported. One woman died from heart complications in the intravenous group. Only two studies reported on maternal deaths. Allergic reactions occurred in three women, and heart complications in two women in the intravenous group. Gastrointestinal symptoms were frequent in the oral group and caused some participants to abandon treatment. One study compared red blood cell transfusion with no transfusion. Some (but not all) fatigue scores temporarily improved in the transfused women. Maternal mortality was not reported. When comparing oral iron to placebo (three studies), anaemia symptoms were not reported. It remains unknown whether benefits of oral iron outweigh documented gastrointestinal harms. Other treatment options were compared in other studies, which did not investigate fatigue. Very few studies reported on relief of anaemia symptoms, although this is perhaps the most important purpose of treatment. The body of evidence did not allow us to fully evaluate the efficacy of the treatments on iron deficiency anaemia after childbirth and further research is needed."
CD013069,"The 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel-group, single-site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as 'straight CT', but we classified some as 'augmented CT', and about two-thirds as multi-domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others. The methodological quality of studies varied, but we rated nearly all studies as having high or unclear risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment, and high or unclear risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. We used data from 32 studies in the meta-analysis of at least one outcome. Relative to a control condition, we found moderate-quality evidence showing a small to moderate effect of CT on our first primary outcome, composite measure of global cognition at end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.62), and high-quality evidence showing a moderate effect on the secondary outcome of verbal semantic fluency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81) at end of treatment, with these gains retained in the medium term (3 to 12 months post treatment). In relation to many other outcomes, including our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term, the quality of evidence was very low, so we were unable to determine whether CT was associated with any meaningful gains. When compared with an alternative treatment, we found that CT may have little to no effect on our first primary outcome of global cognition at end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.64), but the quality of evidence was low. No evidence was available to assess our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term. We found moderate-quality evidence showing that CT was associated with improved mood of the caregiver at end of treatment, but this was based on a single trial. The quality of evidence in relation to many other outcomes at end of treatment and in the medium term was too low for us to determine whether CT was associated with any gains, but we are moderately confident that CT did not lead to any gains in mood, behavioural and psychological symptoms, or capacity to perform activities of daily living. Relative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well-established risks of bias, and should provide long-term follow-up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained. Future trials should also focus on direct comparison of CT versus alternative treatments rather than passive or active control conditions.","We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non-specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term."
CD012445,"Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria, including one ongoing study. The studies compared a mindfulness-enhanced parent training programme with a no-treatment, waitlist, or attentional control (2 studies); a parent training programme with no mindfulness component (5 studies); both a no-treatment, waitlist, or attentional control and a parent training programme with no mindfulness component (4 studies). We assessed all studies as being at an unclear or high risk of bias across multiple domains. We pooled child and parent outcome data from 2118 participants to produce effect estimates. No study explicitly reported on self-compassion, and no adverse effects were reported in any of the studies. Mindfulness-enhanced parent training programmes compared to a no-treatment, waitlist, or attentional control
Very low certainty evidence suggests there may be a small to moderate postintervention improvement in child emotional and behavioural adjustment (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.96 to 0.03; P = 0.06, I2 = 62%; 3 studies, 270 participants); a small improvement in parenting skills (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.39; P = 0.008, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 587 participants); and a moderate decrease in parental depression or anxiety (SMD −0.50, 95% CI −0.96 to −0.04; P = 0.03; 1 study, 75 participants). There may also be a moderate to large decrease in parenting stress (SMD −0.79, 95% CI −1.80 to 0.23; P = 0.13, I2 = 82%; 2 studies, 112 participants) and a small improvement in parent mindfulness (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.56; P = 0.24, I2 = 69%; 3 studies, 515 participants), but we were not able to exclude little to no effect for these outcomes. Mindfulness-enhanced parent training programmes compared to parent training with no mindfulness component
Very low certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference postintervention in child emotional and behavioural adjustment (SMD −0.09, 95% CI −0.58 to 0.40; P = 0.71, I2 = 64%; 5 studies, 203 participants); parenting skills (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.16 to 0.42; P = 0.37, I2 = 16%; 3 studies, 319 participants); and parent mindfulness (SMD 0.11, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.41; P = 0.48, I2 = 44%; 4 studies, 412 participants). There may be a slight decrease in parental depression or anxiety (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.83 to 0.34; P = 0.41; 1 study, 45 participants; very low certainty evidence), though we cannot exclude little to no effect, and a moderate decrease in parenting stress (SMD −0.51, 95% CI −0.84 to −0.18; P = 0.002, I2 = 2%; 3 studies, 150 participants; low certainty evidence). Mindfulness-enhanced parenting training may improve some parent and child outcomes, with no studies reporting adverse effects. Evidence for the added value of mindfulness training to skills-based parenting training programmes is suggestive at present, with moderate reductions in parenting stress. Given the very low to low certainty evidence reviewed here, these estimates will likely change as more high-quality studies are produced.","We explored whether behavioural or skills-based parent training programmes with a mindfulness component – 'mindfulness-enhanced' parent training programmes – can improve outcomes for children and their caregivers. We searched a range of sources for literature that evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-enhanced parent training programmes, including electronic databases, trial registries, and organisations and experts in the field. We included studies evaluating these interventions using randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) or quasi experimental designs (where participants are assigned to different treatment groups using a method that is not truly random). We included studies that assessed child emotional and behavioural adjustment, and/or a range of parent outcomes, including parenting skills, parenting stress, depression or anxiety, mindfulness or self-compassion. We included 11 studies and data from 2118 participants in the review. The studies compared the outcomes of children or parents (or both) who participated in a mindfulness-enhanced parent training programme to the outcomes of children or parents (or both) who did not participate in parent training, or who participated in an alternate behavioural or skills-based parent training programme. When we combined the findings from these studies, we found that mindfulness-enhanced parent training, when compared to no intervention, may improve child emotional and behavioural adjustment, parenting skills, parenting stress, parental depression and anxiety, and mindfulness, but we are very uncertain about these results. Evidence for the added value of mindfulness training when included in a skills-based parent training programme suggests that mindfulness training may further promote reductions in parenting stress, and may also further reduce parental depression or anxiety, but we are uncertain about these results. It is unclear from the current body of evidence whether adding mindfulness training to a skills-based parent training intervention has any further effect on child emotional and behavioural adjustment, parenting skills, or mindfulness. No studies reported adverse effects or measured self-compassion. We are not confident in the overall body of evidence. This is primarily because there was a lot of variation across the interventions and the participant groups, as well as how the outcomes were measured. The studies were also usually quite small, and participants were likely to be aware of what intervention they were receiving, which can sometimes influence the results. It is likely that these findings will change as more studies are undertaken in this area of research. We searched for and included research up to April 2023."
CD013732,"We included 23 studies (enrolling 2023 infants) published between 1992 and 2019. Fifteen studies (1632 infants) compared the use of morphine or fentanyl versus placebo or no intervention. Four studies included both term and preterm infants, and one study only term infants; all other studies included only preterm infants, with five studies including only very preterm infants. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) Scale in the first 12 hours after infusion (MD -5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.88 to -4.59; 50 participants, 2 studies) and between 12 and 48 hours after infusion (MD -0.98, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.61; 963 participants, 3 studies) because of limitations in study design, high heterogeneity (inconsistency), and imprecision of estimates (very low-certainty evidence - GRADE). The use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.83; 1259 participants, 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence because of unclear risk of bias in most studies) and neonatal mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; 1189 participants, 5 studies; moderate-certainty evidence because of imprecision of estimates). We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.29; 78 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence because of serious imprecision of the estimates and indirectness). Limited data were available for the other comparisons (i.e. two studies (54 infants) on morphine versus midazolam, three (222 infants) on morphine versus fentanyl, and one each on morphine versus diamorphine (88 infants), morphine versus remifentanil (20 infants), fentanyl versus sufentanil (20 infants), and fentanyl versus remifentanil (24 infants)). For these comparisons, no meta-analysis was conducted because outcomes were reported by one study. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; the use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Data on the other comparisons planned in this review (opioids versus analgesics; opioids versus other opioids) are extremely limited and do not allow any conclusions. In the absence of firm evidence to support a routine policy, opioids should be used selectively - based on clinical judgement and evaluation of pain indicators - although pain measurement in newborns has limitations.","Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed. The certainty of evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and some studies could have been better designed. We searched for studies that had been published up to 29 September 2020."
CD011179,"We included two trials, but data were available for only 339 men in one trial, of whom 188 underwent invasive urodynamic studies. We found evidence of risk of bias, such as lack of outcome information for 24 men in one arm of the trial. Statistically significant evidence suggests that the tests did change clinical decision making. Men in the invasive urodynamics arm were more likely to have their management changed than men in the control arm (proportion with change in management 24/188 (13%) vs 0/151 (0%), risk ratio (RR) 39.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42 to 642.74). However, the quality of the evidence was low. Low-quality evidence indicates that men in the invasive urodynamics group were less likely to undergo surgery as treatment for voiding LUTS (164/188 (87%) vs 151/151 (100%), RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.92). Investigators observed no difference in urine flow rates before and after surgery for LUTS (mean percentage increase in urine flow rate, 140% in invasive urodynamic group vs 149% in immediate surgery group, P value = 0.13). Similarly, they found no differences between groups with regards to International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (mean percentage decrease in IPSS score, 58% in invasive urodynamics group vs 59% in immediate surgery group, P value = 0.22). No evidence was available to demonstrate whether differences in management equated to improved health outcomes, such as relief of symptoms of voiding dysfunction or improved quality of life. No evidence from randomised trials revealed the adverse effects associated with invasive urodynamic studies. Although invasive urodynamic testing did change clinical decision making, we found no evidence to demonstrate whether this led to reduced symptoms of voiding dysfunction after treatment. Larger definitive trials of better quality are needed, in which men are randomly allocated to management based on invasive urodynamic findings or to management based on findings obtained by other diagnostic means. This research will show whether performance of invasive urodynamics results in reduced symptoms of voiding dysfunction after treatment.","We found two trials, which included around 350 men, although information was available for only 339 men in one trial. Evidence was not sufficient to show whether invasive urodynamic tests led to better patient outcomes. Some evidence suggests that these tests did alter management decisions, resulting in fewer men undergoing surgery. No evidence indicates whether this change in management led to fewer symptoms in men after treatment, and it is not known whether patients reported a better quality of life. No information obtained from the included trials reveals how common side effects were in those undergoing invasive urodynamic testing. Not enough information from trials is available regarding the benefits of invasive urodynamic testing for men with voiding dysfunction. More research is needed in which people are randomly assigned to treatment decisions based on their symptoms, physical examination findings and results of non-invasive tests alone, or based on the extra information provided by invasive urodynamic tests. Future studies will help healthcare providers determine whether patients benefit from these extra tests, and whether the tests provide good value for healthcare systems."
CD008705,"Four small studies (224 participants) were included in the review. Little information was provided about the process of allocating participants to groups. None of the studies used independent outcome assessors, and evidence suggested researcher allegiance towards the active treatments. The four studies examined a diversity of third wave CBT approaches (extended behavioural activation, acceptance and commitment therapy and competitive memory training) and control conditions. None of the studies conducted follow-up assessments. The results showed a significant difference in clinical response rates in favour of third wave CBT when compared with treatment as usual (TAU) conditions (three studies, 170 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.95; very low quality). No significant difference in treatment acceptability based on dropout rates was found between third wave CBT approaches and TAU (four studies, 224 participants, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.08 to 12.30; very low quality). Both analyses showed substantial statistical heterogeneity. Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT approaches appear to be more effective than treatment as usual in the treatment of acute depression. The very small number of available studies and the diverse types of interventions and control comparators, together with methodological limitations, limit the ability to draw any conclusions on their effect in the short term or over a longer term. The increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice underscores the importance of completing further studies of third wave CBT approaches in the treatment of acute depression, on a short- and long-term basis, to provide evidence of their effectiveness to policy-makers, clinicians and users of services.","In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT), helping people to become aware of their thoughts and to accept them in a non-judgemental way. The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was effective and acceptable to people in the acute phase of depression. The review included four studies, involving a total of 224 people. The studies examined three different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of extended behavioural activation (two studies), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (one study) and another form of third wave CBT called competitive mind training (one study). Three of the studies compared third wave CBT approaches with treatment as usual control conditions. The fourth study compared ACT with a psychological placebo condition. The results suggested that third wave CBT approaches were effective on a short-term basis in treating depression. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies/participants included in the review, together with the diverse client groups, interventions and control conditions used and possible allegiance of researchers towards the active treatments, making it difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence. It is notable, too, that none of the studies looked at the long-term effect of third wave CBT approaches. Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further well-designed studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are helpful in treating people with acute depression."
CD007835,"We included 12 trials in this review. There were seven hospital-based and five community-based studies. In four studies maternal vaginal wash with chlorhexidine was done in addition to neonatal skin and cord care. Newborn skin or cord cleansing with chlorhexidine compared to usual care in hospitals
Low-quality evidence from one trial showed that chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.04). Moderate-quality evidence from two trials showed that chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care probably reduces the risk of omphalitis/infections (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.84). Low-quality evidence from two trials showed that chlorhexidine skin cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in omphalitis/infections (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.39). None of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on neonatal mortality. Newborn skin or cord cleansing with chlorhexidine compared to usual care in the community
High-quality evidence from three trials showed that chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care reduces neonatal mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92) and omphalitis/infections (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.57). High-quality evidence from one trial showed no difference between chlorhexidine skin cleansing and usual skin care on neonatal mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23). None of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on omphalitis/infections. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention (sterile saline solution) in hospitals
Moderate-quality evidence from one trial showed no difference between maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing and no intervention on neonatal mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42). High-quality evidence from two trials showed no difference between maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing and no intervention on the risk of infections (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16). Findings from one trial showed that maternal vaginal cleansing in addition to total body cleansing results in increased risk of hypothermia (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.49). Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention (sterile saline solution) in the community
Low-quality evidence from one trial showed no difference between maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing and no intervention on neonatal mortality (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03). Moderate-quality evidence from one trial showed that maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention probably reduces the risk of neonatal infections (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95). These studies did not report effect on omphalitis. There is some uncertainty as to the effect of chlorhexidine applied to the umbilical cords of newborns in hospital settings on neonatal mortality. The quality of evidence for the effects on infection are moderate for cord application and low for application to skin. There is high-quality evidence that chlorhexidine skin or cord care in the community setting results in a 50% reduction in the incidence of omphalitis and a 12% reduction in neonatal mortality. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine compared to usual care probably leads to no difference in neonatal mortality in hospital settings. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine compared to usual care results in no difference in the risk of infections in hospital settings. The uncertainty over the effect of maternal vaginal chlorhexidine on mortality outcomes reflects small sample sizes and low event rates in the community settings.","We searched the medical literature for studies done in hospitals and communities that evaluated infections and deaths in newborns randomly assigned to receive either chlorhexidine care or the standard practice. Searches were done up to November 2013. There were 12 relevant studies found: there were seven hospital-based and five community-based studies. In four studies maternal vaginal wash with chlorhexidine was done in addition to neonatal skin and cord care. The durations of the included studies ranged from 6 months to 37 months. The number of participants in the included studies ranged from 112 to 29,760. None of the included studies declared any conflict of interest or were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality. However, chlorhexidine cord cleansing probably reduces the risk of omphalitis or infections. Chlorhexidine skin cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in omphalitis or infections (none of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on neonatal mortality). Chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis or infections. There was no difference between chlorhexidine skin cleansing and usual skin care on neonatal mortality (none of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on omphalitis or infections). Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no probably leads to no difference in neonatal mortality and infections. Maternal vaginal cleansing in addition to total body cleansing increases the risk of hypothermia. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention probably reduces the risk of neonatal infections (none of the studies included in this comparison reported effects on omphalitis). The confidence in estimate of effect (quality of evidence) for the effects of chlorhexidine on neonatal mortality and omphalitis or infections were varied (low, moderate and high). Main reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were poorly conducted studies and lack of enough data."
CD007979,"The previous version of this review included one randomised controlled trial involving 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers at baseline. It compared an email to physicians containing patient-specific osteoporosis risk information and guidelines for evaluation and treatment versus usual care (no email). This study was at high risk of bias for the allocation concealment and blinding domains. The email reminder changed health professional actions significantly, with professionals more likely to provide guideline-recommended osteoporosis treatment (bone density measurement or osteoporosis medication, or both) when compared with usual care. The evidence for its impact on patient behaviours or actions was inconclusive. One measure found that the electronic medical reminder message impacted patient behaviour positively (patients had a higher calcium intake), and two found no difference between the two groups. The study did not assess health service outcomes or harms. No new studies were identified for this update. Only one study was identified for inclusion, providing insufficient evidence for guiding clinical practice in regard to the use of email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals. Future research should aim to utilise high-quality study designs that use the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention.","In this review, we found only one study that focused on the effects of healthcare professionals using email to communicate with each other. This study included 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers, and compared an email reminder for physicians with usual care. It found that healthcare professionals who received an email reminder were more likely to provide guideline-recommended osteoporosis treatment than those who did not, and this may or may not have improved patient care. We were unable to properly assess its impact on patient behaviours or actions as the results were mixed. The study did not measure how email affects health services, or whether email can cause harms. This evidence is current to August 2013. As there is a lack of evidence for the effects of healthcare professionals using email to communicate with each other, high-quality research is needed to evaluate the use of email for this purpose. Future research should look at the costs of using email and take into account ongoing changes in technology."
CD003719,"We included 18 RCTs involving 2952 participants; 15 compared rhCG with uhCG, and 3 compared rhLH with uhCG. The evidence for different comparisons ranged from very low to high quality: limitations were poor reporting of study methods and imprecision. Pharmaceutical companies funded 9 of the 18 studies, and 5 studies did not clearly report funding source. Ongoing pregnancy/live birth
There was no conclusive evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.49; 7 RCTs, N = 1136, I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence) or between rhLH and uhCG (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.78, 2 RCTs, N = 289, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence) for ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates. OHSS
There was no evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG in the incidence of OHSS: moderate to severe OHSS (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 8.45; 3 RCTs, N = 417, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence), moderate OHSS (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.27; 1 RCT, N = 243, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence), mild to moderate OHSS (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.38; 2 RCTs, N = 320, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or undefined OHSS (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.78; 3 RCTs, N = 495, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence). Likewise, there was no evidence of a difference between rhLH and uhCG in OHSS rates for moderate OHSS (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.69, 2 RCTs, N = 280, I2 = 5%, very low quality evidence). Other adverse events
There was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates between rhCG and uhCG (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25; 8 RCTs, N = 1196, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or between rhLH and uhCG (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.40; 2 RCTs, N = 289, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence). For other adverse effects (most commonly injection-site reactions) rhCG was associated with a lower number of adverse events than uhCG (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.76; 5 RCTS, N = 561; I2 = 67%, moderate quality evidence). However, when we used a random-effects model due to substantial statistical heterogeneity, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.13). Only one study comparing rLH and uhCG reported other adverse events, and it was impossible to draw conclusions. We conclude that there is no evidence of a difference between rhCG or rhLH and uhCG for live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates or rates of OHSS.","We found 18 studies in 2952 women undergoing IVF or ICSI. Fifteen trials in 2473 women compared rhCG with uhCG, and three trials in 479 women compared rLH with uhCG. Women in the studies were 18 to 45 years old, with regular menstrual cycles and no history of OHSS. Types of subfertility included tubal disease, endometriosis, unexplained infertility and male factor infertility. Pharmaceutical companies funded 9 of the 18 studies; 4 studies were free of commercial funding, and the remaining 5 studies did not clearly report a funding source. The evidence is current to April 2015. There was no evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG or between RhLH and uhCG in rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy or OHSS. Studies did not report much evidence on adverse events other than OHSS, and the evidence they did report was inconclusive. For the comparison 'rhCG versus uhCG', the evidence was of moderate quality for ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate and of low quality for incidence of OHSS. The main limitation of the evidence was lack of precision (i.e. study size was too small to rule out the role of chance). For the comparison 'rLH versus uhCG', the evidence was of very low quality for both ongoing pregnancy/live birth rate and incidence of OHSS. The main limitations of the evidence were lack of precision and poor reporting of study methods."
CD007400,"We identified five new studies for this update, which now has information from 10,857 participants in 39 studies, a 41% increase in participants from the earlier review; 32 studies compared a topical NSAID with carrier. All studies examined topical NSAIDs for treatment of osteoarthritis, and for pooled analyses studies were generally of moderate or high methodological quality, although we considered some at risk of bias from short duration and small size. In studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen were significantly more effective than carrier for reducing pain; about 60% of participants had much reduced pain. With topical diclofenac, the NNT for clinical success in six trials (2353 participants) was 9.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1 to 16) (moderate quality evidence). With topical ketoprofen, the NNT for clinical success in four trials (2573 participants) was 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3) (moderate quality evidence). There was too little information for analysis of other individual topical NSAIDs compared with carrier. Few trials compared a topical NSAID to an oral NSAID, but overall they showed similar efficacy (low quality evidence). These efficacy results were almost completely derived from people with knee osteoarthritis. There was an increase in local adverse events (mostly mild skin reactions) with topical diclofenac compared with carrier or oral NSAIDs, but no increase with topical ketoprofen (moderate quality evidence). Reporting of systemic adverse events (such as gastrointestinal upsets) was poor, but where reported there was no difference between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were infrequent and not different between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Clinical success with carrier occurred commonly - in around half the participants in studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks. Both direct and indirect comparison of clinical success with oral placebo indicates that response rates with carrier (topical placebo) are about twice those seen with oral placebo. A substantial amount of data from completed, unpublished studies was unavailable (up to 6000 participants). To the best of our knowledge, much of this probably relates to formulations that have never been marketed. Topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen can provide good levels of pain relief beyond carrier in osteoarthritis for a minority of people, but there is no evidence for other chronic painful conditions. There is emerging evidence that at least some of the substantial placebo effects seen in longer duration studies derive from effects imparted by the NSAID carrier itself, and that NSAIDs add to that.","This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults', originally published in 2012. We found 39 generally high-quality studies with 10,857 participants where topical NSAID was used at least once a day. These studies tested a number of different topical drugs, mostly against a topical placebo. We were interested in participants having good pain reduction (by about half), ideally 6 to 12 weeks after treatment started. Studies that last longer are more representative of the real world, because in these chronic conditions the pain almost never goes away if untreated. We looked at individual NSAIDs to see how effective they were. Diclofenac and ketoprofen were the only two with good quality and longer duration studies, mostly in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. The comparison was between topical diclofenac or ketoprofen in a solution or gel, and the solution or gel without any drug in it (topical placebo). For diclofenac and ketoprofen, about 6 people out of 10 with osteoarthritis had much reduced pain after 6 to 12 weeks, compared with 5 out of 10 with topical placebo (moderate quality evidence). Skin reactions (mostly mild) were more common (20 in 100) with topical diclofenac than topical placebo (5 in 100); there was no difference between topical ketoprofen and topical placebo (moderate quality evidence). Other adverse events, like stomach upsets, were poorly reported in these studies, but were no different between topical diclofenac or ketoprofen and topical placebo (very low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were uncommon. We rated the quality of the evidence for topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen compared with placebo as moderate for efficacy, and very low for harmful effects. Moderate quality evidence means that further research may change our estimate of the effect, and very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the accuracy of our estimate."
CD008397,"Eighteen RCTs out of 64 potentially eligible study reports met the inclusion criteria. They compared undertaking a sinus lift with not doing so, and the use of different sinus lift techniques. There were 650 patients providing data for the outcomes evaluated. Five studies were assessed as low risk of bias, 11 were assessed as high risk of bias, and in two the risk was unclear. Sinus lift versus no sinus lift 
Four trials of moderate quality (three trials at low and one at high risk of bias) with 102 participants evaluated short implants (5 to 8.5 mm long) as an alternative to sinus lift in bone with residual height between 4 and 9 mm. One year after loading there was insufficient evidence to claim differences between the two procedures for prosthesis failure (OR (Peto) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 2.68; three trials) or implant failure (OR (Peto) 0.44, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.99; four trials). There was however an increase in complications at treated sites when undertaking the sinus lift (OR (Peto) 4.77, 95% CI 1.79 to 12.71, P value = 0.002; four trials). Different sinus lift techniques 
Fourteen trials with 548 participants compared different sinus lift techniques. Only three comparisons included more than one trial (two trials for each). These were bone graft versus no bone graft, autogenous bone versus bone substitute, bone graft with or without platelet-rich plasma (PRP). There was insufficient evidence to claim a benefit for any of these techniques for the primary outcomes of prosthesis and implant failure. For the other reported outcomes, in a single study at high risk of bias, only bone gain was greater for the bone graft site than the site without a graft six months after augmentation, however this was not significant at 18 or 30 months. The other comparisons with single studies were rotary versus piezosurgery to open a lateral sinus window, two different bone substitutes, use or not of a membrane to seal the lateral window, one- versus two-stage lateral sinus lift, two-stage granular bone versus one-stage autogenous bone blocks, and crestal versus lateral sinus lift; two trials compared three different crestal sinus lifting techniques: rotatory versus hand malleting (patients preferred rotatory instruments over hand malleting) and hand versus electric malleting. There was no evidence of a benefit for any sinus lift procedure compared to any other for the primary outcomes prosthesis or implant failure. There is moderate quality evidence which is insufficient to determine whether sinus lift procedures in bone with residual height between 4 and 9 mm are more or less successful than placing short implants (5 to 8.5 mm) in reducing prosthesis or implant failure up to one year after loading. However, there are more complications at sites treated with sinus lift procedures. Many trials compared different sinus lift procedures and none of these indicated that one procedure reduced prosthetic or implant failures when compared to the other. Based on low quality evidence, patients may prefer rotary instruments over hand malleting for crestal sinus lift.","The evidence on which this review is based is correct as of 17 January 2014. Eighteen trials with 650 participants were included. Four of the trials, with a total of 102 participants, compared implant-supported prostheses using a sinus lift with prostheses on short implants (5 to 8.5 mm long) without sinus lift. The remaining 14 trials with a total of 548 participants compared different sinus lift techniques. There is not enough evidence to show whether sinus lift techniques are more or less successful in reducing the number of failures of dental prostheses (artificial teeth) or dental implants when compared to simply using short implants, up to one year after loading. However, there is limited evidence that there are fewer complications when short implants are used without surgical lifts. Complications include sinusitis, infection and bleeding, and when bone grafts are taken from the patient complications can also include nerve injury, problems with walking and infection. The quality of the evidence for whether or not to use a sinus lift procedure was moderate. The evidence for the 14 comparisons of different sinus lift procedures was based on a maximum of two comparisons for each comparison and was low."
CD012681,"We included 30 studies (18,682 participants in total). Eighteen studies contributed to the main objective and 22 studies contributed to the secondary objectives. We found substantial differences between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and sample size. All included studies scored at least one 'Risk of bias' item as unclear or high risk. We identified both clinical and statistical heterogeneity and therefore could not pool results, so we present them descriptively. Eighteen studies (describing 14,573 survivors) reported the prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. In a subgroup of three studies including children aged up to 18 years at fatigue assessment (268 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. In comparison, in a subgroup of 12 studies including participants aged 16 and over (13,952 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. The prevalence of severe fatigue in a subgroup of survivors of haematological cancer was presented in seven studies and ranged from 1.8% to 35.9% (1907 survivors). Prevalence of severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors was presented in two studies (252 survivors) and was 14.6% and 21.1% respectively. One study presented a prevalence for bone cancer survivors of 0.0% (17 survivors). Four studies provided prevalence rates of severe fatigue in control groups of siblings or population-based controls, which ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls, but this difference was statistically significant in only two studies. Studies assessing risk and associated factors for fatigue were heterogeneous, and definitions of the factors under study were often inconsistent, with results therefore presented descriptively. They found that depression might be associated with fatigue. In contrast, age at diagnosis and education level did not seem to be associated with fatigue. We were unable to calculate any overall risk estimate for any of the reported risks and associated factors, because we could not conduct meta-analysis. One study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years, 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. It is unclear how many childhood cancer survivors suffer from severe fatigue. This review encountered several difficulties. We found statistical and clinical heterogeneity and great variation in the reporting of possible risk and associated factors. The evidence in this review is therefore weak, and the exact prevalence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains to be determined. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue following treatment and the strength of the relationship between fatigue and associated and risk factors. Despite these limitations, our review does provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature about severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer.","The evidence is up to date to March 2019. We include 30 studies, describing 18,682 participants after treatment for childhood cancer. We found a lot of variation between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, the questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and the size of the study. Eighteen studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. Four studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue in the patient's brothers and sisters or in population-based controls. Prevalence rates in these control groups ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls. This difference was only significant in two studies. When we looked at the prevalence of severe fatigue in survivors of lymphoma and leukaemia (types of blood cancers), we found that they ranged from 1.8% to 35.9%. Two studies reported on severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors, with rates of 21.13% and 14.6%. One study in bone cancer survivors reported no cases of severe fatigue. For survivors aged 18 and younger, prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. By contrast, in studies including participants aged 16 years and over (but mostly over 18), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. Twenty-two studies assessed one or more possible risk factors for fatigue. Our review shows that depression might increase fatigue. The age at cancer diagnosis and the education level of the survivor did not seem to influence fatigue. Only one study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. All included studies had problems with the quality of the evidence, and we found many differences between studies for several characteristics. The evidence to address our review question is therefore weak. The occurrence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains uncertain. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue after completion of cancer treatment and the risk factors that might be responsible for developing fatigue."
CD001822,"We included 41 articles reporting on 25 RCTs with 4404 participants. Risk of bias was low in 16 studies. Three studies involved workers with acute back pain, eight studies workers with subacute back pain, and 14 studies workers with chronic back pain. In 14 studies, physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy was compared to usual care. The physical conditioning mostly consisted of graded activity with work-related exercises aimed at increasing back strength and flexibility, together with a set date for return to work. The programmes were divided into a light version with a maximum of five sessions, or an intense version with more than five sessions up to full time or as inpatient treatment. For acute back pain, there was low quality evidence that both light and intense physical conditioning programmes made little or no difference in sickness absence duration compared with care as usual at three to 12 months follow-up (3 studies with 340 workers). For subacute back pain, the evidence on the effectiveness of intense physical conditioning combined with care as usual compared to usual care alone was conflicting (four studies with 395 workers). However, subgroup analysis showed low quality evidence that if the intervention was executed at the workplace, or included a workplace visit, it may have reduced sickness absence duration at 12 months follow-up (3 studies with 283 workers; SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.18). For chronic back pain, there was low quality evidence that physical conditioning as part of integrated care management in addition to usual care may have reduced sickness absence days compared to usual care at 12 months follow-up (1 study, 134 workers; SMD -4.42, 95% CI -5.06 to -3.79). What part of the integrated care management was most effective remained unclear. There was moderate quality evidence that intense physical conditioning probably reduced sickness absence duration only slightly compared with usual care at 12 months follow-up (5 studies, 1093 workers; SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.03). Physical conditioning compared to exercise therapy showed conflicting results for workers with subacute and chronic back pain. Cognitive behavioural therapy was probably not superior to physical conditioning as an alternative or in addition to physical conditioning. The effectiveness of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy in reducing sick leave for workers with back pain, compared to usual care or exercise therapy, remains uncertain. For workers with acute back pain, physical conditioning may have no effect on sickness absence duration. There is conflicting evidence regarding the reduction of sickness absence duration with intense physical conditioning versus usual care for workers with subacute back pain. It may be that including workplace visits or execution of the intervention at the workplace is the component that renders a physical conditioning programme effective. For workers with chronic back pain physical conditioning has a small effect on reducing sick leave compared to care as usual after 12 months follow-up. To what extent physical conditioning as part of integrated care management may alter the effect on sick leave for workers with chronic back pain needs further research.","The evidence was current to March 2012. We analysed 17 comparisons of physical conditioning as part of a return to work strategy. Some trials examined physical conditioning in addition to care as usual versus care as usual only, and others compared physical conditioning to other types of interventions such as standard exercise therapy. Participants had either acute back pain (duration of symptoms less than six weeks), subacute back pain (duration of symptoms more than six but less than 12 weeks), or chronic back pain (duration of symptoms more than 12 weeks). Participants were followed for anywhere from three weeks to three years. We divided physical conditioning into light or intense, depending on its intensity and duration. Results showed that light physical conditioning has no effect on sickness absence duration for workers with subacute or chronic back pain. We found conflicting results for intense physical conditioning for workers with subacute back pain. Intense physical conditioning probably had a small effect on reducing sick leave at 12 months follow-up compared to usual care for workers with chronic back pain. Involving the workplace, or physical conditioning being part of integrated care management may have had a positive effect on reducing sick leave, but this needs further research. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Although 16 of the included studies were well designed and had no major flaws, some studies were poorly conducted and the small number of participants in most studies lowered the overall quality of the evidence."
CD002796,"We have included nine studies in this review. All were part of the original systematic review; no new trials meeting eligibility criteria were identified through our updated searches. The studies were conducted in eight different states of the USA, during the years 1967 to 1992. Nearly 1000 (946) juveniles or young adults of different races participated, almost all males. The average age of the participants in each study ranged from 15 to 17 years. Meta-analyses of seven studies show the intervention to be more harmful than doing nothing. The OR (fixed-effect) for effects on first post-treatment effect on officially measured criminal behavior indicated a negative program effect (OR 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 2.36) and nearly identical regardless of the meta-analytic strategy (random-effects OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.62). Sensitivity analyses (random-effects) showed the findings were robust even when removing one study with an inadequate randomization strategy (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.11), or when removing one study with high attrition (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.08), or both (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.58). We conclude that programs such as 'Scared Straight' increase delinquency relative to doing nothing at all to similar youths. Given these results, we cannot recommend this program as a crime prevention strategy. Agencies that permit such programs, therefore, must rigorously evaluate them, to ensure that they do not cause more harm than good to the very citizens they pledge to protect.","This review, which is an update of one published in 2002, includes nine studies that involved 946 teenagers, almost all males. The studies were conducted in different parts of the USA and involved young people of different races whose average age ranged from 15 to 17 years. Results indicate that not only do these programs fail to deter crime, but they actually lead to more offending behavior. The intervention increases the odds of offending by between 1.6 to 1 and 1.7 to 1. Government officials permitting this program need to adopt rigorous evaluation efforts to ensure that they are not causing more harm to the very citizens they pledge to protect."
CD001040,"Seven trials assessing 4556 women were identified. Three trials included women with stage one disease only, whereas four included women with more advanced disease. Meta-analysis of four trials showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of death at five years between adjuvant progestagen therapy and no further treatment (RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). This conclusion is also robust to single trial analyses at 4 and 7 years and in one trial across all points in time using a hazard ratio (HR). There was also no significant difference between progestagen therapy and control in terms of the risk of death from endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease and intercurrent disease. Relapse of disease appeared to be reduced by progestagen therapy in one trial (HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97 and 5 year RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96), but there was no evidence of a difference in disease recurrence in another trial at 7 years (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.27). There is no evidence to support the use of adjuvant progestagen therapy in the primary treatment of endometrial cancer. There have now been several RCTs which have failed to establish a role for adjuvant progestagen therapy after primary treatment for endometrial cancer and therefore, further trials in this field are probably not justified.","Endometrial (womb) cancer is the most common genital tract cancer in developed countries. Progestagen (a hormone) therapy is sometimes used following initial surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, progestagens have been found to reduce one of the protective factors against heart disease and may also make tumours more resistant to radiotherapy. This review found no evidence to support the use of progestagen as an addition to surgery for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. Progestagen can, however, prevent or delay recurrence of cancer in some patients."
CD009744,"We included 23 RCTs that were published between 1968 and 2015 and included 39,195 participants in total. The mean age ranged from 33 to 71 years. The median duration of treatment was 11.5 months, and the median dose of niacin was 2 g/day. The proportion of participants with prior myocardial infarction ranged from 0% (4 trials) to 100% (2 trials, median proportion 48%); the proportion of participants taking statin ranged from 0% (4 trials) to 100% (12 trials, median proportion 100%). Using available cases, niacin did not reduce overall mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.12; participants = 35,543; studies = 12; I2 = 0%; high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; participants = 32,966; studies = 5; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), non-cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.28; participants = 32,966; studies = 5; I2 = 0%; high-quality evidence), the number of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; participants = 34,829; studies = 9; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), nor the number of fatal or non-fatal strokes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.22; participants = 33,661; studies = 7; I2 = 42%; low-quality evidence). Participants randomised to niacin were more likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects than participants randomised to control group (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.77; participants = 33,539; studies = 17; I2 = 77%; moderate-quality evidence). The results were robust to sensitivity analyses using different assumptions for missing data. Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that niacin does not reduce mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, the number of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions, nor the number of fatal or non-fatal strokes but is associated with side effects. Benefits from niacin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease events are unlikely.","We found 23 studies including 39,195 participants that compared niacin to placebo. The evidence is current up to August 2016. The majority of included participants were on average 65 years old and had already experienced a myocardial infarction. The participants took niacin or placebo for a period of between six months and five years. Seventeen out of 23 studies were fully or partially funded by the drug manufacturer with a commercial interest in the results of the studies. Niacin did not reduce the number of deaths, heart attack or stroke. Many people (18%) had to stop taking niacin due to side effects. The results did not differ between participants who had or had not experienced a heart attack before taking niacin. The results did not differ between participants who were or were not taking a statin (another drug that prevents heart attack and stroke). The overall quality of evidence was moderate to high. In summary, we found no evidence of benefits from niacin therapy."
CD010073,"We included three quasi-randomised controlled trials, with a total of 149 women and their babies. All three trials were at a high risk of bias. When comparing women receiving relaxin with those who did not receive relaxin, there was a significant reduction in birth within seven days of treatment in one trial of 30 women (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.87), yet no significant difference was seen for perinatal mortality in this trial (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.15). The second and third included trials did not report on any of the primary outcomes pre-specified in the review, including birth within 48 hours of treatment, birth within seven days of treatment, perinatal mortality, and serious neonatal adverse outcomes. One trial found a significant increase in pregnancy prolongation for women receiving relaxin (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.14 to 56.33; 30 women). None of the three included trials found significant differences in the outcomes of fetal death, neonatal death, birthweight or preterm birth, and no trial reported on longer-term outcomes for the babies. There is limited randomised controlled trial evidence available on the effect of relaxin during pregnancy for preventing preterm birth for women in preterm labour. Evidence from one quasi-randomised trial suggested a reduction in birth within seven days of treatment for women receiving relaxin, compared with women in a control group, however this trial was at a high risk of bias and included only 30 women. There is thus insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of relaxin in women in preterm labour for preventing preterm birth.","We included three small randomised trials involving 149 women in preterm labour in the review. These trials were conducted in the 1950s and had a high risk of bias overall. We found no convincing evidence that relaxin (given by intravenous and intramuscular injection) can prevent preterm birth for women in preterm labour. Only one of the studies, involving 30 women (and at a high risk of bias), reported on birth within seven days of treatment and found that women who received relaxin were less likely to give birth preterm within seven days of treatment, and were more likely to have a longer pregnancy than women who did not receive relaxin. The risk of babies dying was not significantly different between the women who received relaxin and those who did not. Neither of the other two trials found clear differences in preterm birth, and no trial reported on longer-term outcomes for the babies. There is therefore insufficient evidence from this review to recommend relaxin as an intervention to prevent preterm birth for women in preterm labour."
CD009350,"Eight studies with 390,769 participants were included. Five studies used a prospective cohort design, two were case-control studies and one a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The methodological quality was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The three prospective cohort studies were of high methodological quality, and two were of medium quality. The two case-control studies were of medium methodological quality. The results form the studies assessing associations between flavonoids, colorectal cancer and adenomas were contradictory. There was no evidence that total flavonoid intake reduced the risk of colorectal neoplasms. The evidence for Isoflavones, Flavonols, Flavones and Flavanones was conflicting. For Flavan-3-ols, the results from two studies suggested that increased intake of Flavan-3-ols reduced the risk of both CRC and colorectal adenomas. A statistically significant reduced risk of CRC was found with high intake of epicatechin. There was medium quality evidence to support that increased intake of procyanidin and phytoestrogen could reduced the incidence of CRC. There was no evidence that suggested that high anthocyanin intake had an inverse association with colorectal adenomas. There is insufficient and conflicting evidence regarding flavonoid intake and the prevention of colorectal neoplasms. It is difficult to determine flavonoid intake. Therefore, more evidence is needed to clarify the association between flavonoids and colorectal neoplasms.","Eight studies with 390,769 participants, mainly observational, were included in this systematic review. The aim of the studies reviewed was to determine an association of the intake of total flavonoids, and eight main flavonoid subclasses, with colorectal neoplasms including CRC and adenomas. The majority of the studies were of medium to high methodological quality. The evidence that intake of dietary flavonoids reduces the risk of colorectal neoplasms was conflicting, and could partly be explained due to difficulties in quantifying the intake of flavonoids. Therefore, the association of dietary flavonoids and prevention of colorectal neoplasms remains unproven."
CD007337,"Eighty-five completed trials were included, of which 76 trials contributed data to one or more of the outcomes. This included a total of 4957 participants randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (2803 participants) and control (2154 participants). Most trials only included participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and those who were at low anaesthetic risk (ASA I and II). The most commonly used local anaesthetic agent was bupivacaine. Methods of instilling the local anaesthetic varied considerably between trials; this included location and timing of application. The control groups received 0.9% normal saline (69 trials), no intervention (six trials), or sterile water (two trials). One trial did not specify the control agent used. None of the trials provided information on follow-up beyond point of discharge from hospital. Only two trials were at low risk of bias. Seven trials received external funding, of these three were assessed to be at risk of conflicts of interest, a further 17 trials declared no funding. We are very uncertain about the effect intraperitoneal local anaesthetic versus control on mortality; zero mortalities in either group (8 trials; 446 participants; very low-certainty evidence); serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.34); 13 trials; 988 participants; discharge on same day of surgery (RR 1.43; 95% CI 0.64 to 3.20; 3 trials; 242 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found that intraperitoneal local anaesthetic probably results in a small reduction in length of hospital stay (MD −0.10 days; 95% CI −0.18 to −0.01; 12 trials; 936 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No trials reported data on health-related quality of life, return to normal activity or return to work. Pain scores, as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), were lower in the intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation group compared to the control group at both four to eight hours (MD −0.99 cm VAS; 95% CI −1.19 to −0.79; 57 trials; 4046 participants; low-certainty of evidence) and nine to 24 hours (MD −0.68 cm VAS; 95% CI −0.88 to −0.49; 52 trials; 3588 participants; low-certainty of evidence). In addition, we found two trials that were still ongoing, and one trial that was completed but with no published results. All three trials are registered on the WHO trial register. We are very uncertain about the effect estimate of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic for laparoscopic cholecystectomy on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and proportion of patients discharged on the same day of surgery because the certainty of evidence was very low. Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude an increase in adverse events. We found that intraperitoneal local anaesthetic probably results in a small reduction in length of stay in hospital after surgery. We found that intraperitoneal local anaesthetic may reduce pain at up to 24 hours for low-risk patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Future randomised clinical trials should be at low risk of systematic and random errors, should fully report mortality and side effects, and should focus on clinical outcomes such as quality of life.","We searched medical literature databases to 19 January 2021. We searched reference lists of studies retrieved. We also searched other resources to identify unpublished or ongoing trials to 10 September 2021. We identified 85 completed trials, with 76 trials (4957 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy) contributing data to at least one of the outcomes. The majority of participants were fit and healthy and undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a planned basis. Participants were randomly assigned to receiving local anaesthetic (or not) to ensure the groups being compared were as similar as possible. Seven trials received funding for their research from external bodies, of these three trials were assessed to be at risk of conflicts of interest. A further 17 trials declared no funding. There were no deaths noted in the eight trials that reported deaths. Thirteen trials reported on serious side effects (for example low heart rate or blood pressure) and did not demonstrate a difference in rates of side effects between those receiving local anaesthetic and those receiving the control. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Twelve trials reported the length of hospital stay after surgery and demonstrated small difference in length of stay in the intraperitoneal group. Three trials reported on same day of surgery discharge and demonstrated no difference between local anaesthetic and control. Pain scores were lower in the group receiving intraperitoneal anaesthetic compared to those receiving controls at four to eight hours (57 trials; 4046 participants) and nine to 24 hours (52 trials; 3588 participants) as measured by a visual analogue score (a chart from 1cm to 10cm to indicate the level of pain). None of the trials reported return to activity or return to work. In addition, we found two trials that are still ongoing, and one trial that was completed but with no published results. The three trials are registered on the WHO trial register. The majority of the trials were at high risk of bias, this means that there was a chance that the wrong conclusions were reached because of the way the study was conducted. For the majority of outcomes a high degree of concern regarding the imprecision of our results contributed to a reduction in certainty in our conclusions. This means we are uncertain about where the value of true effect lies. Overall, the strength of the evidence was assessed to be of very low or low certainty, which means the benefits or harms of local anaesthetic for laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be greater or smaller. Serious adverse events were rare (very low-certainty evidence). We found moderate-certainty evidence that intraperitoneal local anaesthetic probably results in a reduction in length of hospital stay. We did not find any clear evidence that intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation affects the proportion of patients that are discharged the same day of surgery. We found that intra-peritoneal local anaesthetic administration reduces pain scores after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a randomised trial setting, but this evidence was of low certainty. Further trials are necessary. Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment."
CD006276,"Only one additional RCT met the eligibility criteria (24 participants) for this updated review. Although this was a feasibility study, not designed to investigate intervention effect, it suggested that TENS may improve bone pain on movement in a cancer population. The initial review identified two RCTs (64 participants) therefore this review now includes a total of three RCTs (88 participants). These studies were heterogenous with respect to study population, sample size, study design, methodological quality, mode of TENS, treatment duration, method of administration and outcome measures used. In one RCT, there were no significant differences between TENS and placebo in women with chronic pain secondary to breast cancer treatment. In the other RCT, there were no significant differences between acupuncture-type TENS and sham in palliative care patients; this study was underpowered. Despite the one additional RCT, the results of this updated systematic review remain inconclusive due to a lack of suitable RCTs. Large multi-centre RCTs are required to assess the value of TENS in the management of cancer-related pain in adults.","Only one new study met eligibility criteria for this review update, making at total of three included studies. TENS was given to 15 participants in one study, 41 participants in the other and 24 participants in the most recently included study. The newly included study suggested TENS might improve cancer bone pain on movement, but as a pilot study it was not designed to determine the impact of TENS on pain. The two studies in the previous review did not show that TENS significantly improved cancer pain. One study did not have sufficient participants to determine whether or not TENS had an effect. TENS was well tolerated in all three studies. There were significant differences in participants, treatments, procedures and symptom measurement tools used in the studies. In two of the studies some participants were able to identify when they received active TENS and when they received placebo. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to judge whether TENS should be used in adults with cancer-related pain. Further research using well designed clinical trials is needed to improve knowledge in this field."
CD006912,"Five retrospective cohort studies (535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) that used appropriate statistical methods for adjustment were included in the review. Two studies, which carried out multivariate analyses that attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), reported no apparent evidence of a difference in overall survival between surgical approaches, whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all participants combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study. One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent surgery alone (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 0.6, P value 0.04). Three studies reportedthat there was no evidence of differences in disease recurrence based on execution and type of adjuvant chemotherapy or on type of surgery or surgical approach, other than that surgical staging may be important. One study described no apparent evidence of a difference in disease recurrence between fertility-sparing surgery and conventional surgery. Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study. Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life (QoL). All studies were at very high risk of bias. One study showed a lower recurrence rate with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, although this study was at high risk of bias and the results should be interpreted with caution. After evaluating the five small retrospective studies, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of different types and approaches of surgery, including conservative surgery, as well as adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for management of GCTs of the ovary. The available evidence is very limited, and the review provides only low-quality evidence. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may alter our findings. Ideally, multinational RCTs are needed to answer these questions. The disease is relatively rare and generally has a good prognosis. RCTs are challenging to conduct, but three ongoing trials have been identified, demonstrating that they are feasible, although two of these studies are single-arm trials. The study that may be able to provide answers to the question of which chemotherapeutic regimen should be selected for management of sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing, randomised, phase 2 study, led by the Gynaecological Oncology Group to compare the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel versus standard BEP. These investigators are also looking into the value of inhibin A and inhibin B as predictive biomarkers. Additional trials are required to assess toxicity and QoL associated with different treatment regimens as well as the safety of conservative surgical options.","Five retrospective studies (including 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) met our inclusion criteria. Two studies, which attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), suggested that no apparent evidence could be found of differences in overall survival between surgical approaches (including whether the surgery was keyhole or open) whether a patient underwent lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all women combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study. One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent only surgery. In three studies, no apparent evidence to suggest that disease recurrence was associated with type of adjuvant chemotherapy or type of surgery, although surgical staging may be important. In one study, disease recurrence was not noted to be different between patients who underwent fertility-sparing surgery, where only the affected fallopian tube and ovary were removed, and those treated with conventional surgery, in which both tubes and ovaries were removed. Given the high overall survival rate, fertility-sparing surgery may be an important treatment option for young patients wishing to have children in the future. Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study. Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life. All studies were at very high risk of bias (low quality). All five studies were retrospective (looked at past findings) and were at very high risk of bias (low quality); therefore future studies should look at current evidence in randomised studies on adult GCT of the ovary. Three randomised studies comparing chemotherapy are ongoing. The study that may be able to answer the question regarding best choice of chemotherapy in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised study comparing the efficacy of two drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus standard chemotherapy (BEP - bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin). Overall, the evidence in this review is of low quality, which may seriously weaken confidence in the results. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on evidence provided in the future. The effectiveness and safety of different ways of treating patients with adult-onset granulosa cell tumour of the ovary have not yet been assessed by high-quality studies. Such trials are required to assess toxicity and quality of life associated with different treatments and to assess the safety of the types of surgery used. Generally, current evidence is not robust enough to allow recommendations for changes in clinical practice."
CD007563,"Four studies involving 1265 women met the inclusion criteria. In our meta-analysis to compare HDR and LDR ICBT, the pooled risk ratios (RRs) were 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.15), 0.93 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.04) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.20) for 3-, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates respectively; and 0.95 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) and 1.02 (0.88 to 1.19) for 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rates respectively. The RR for RFS was 1.04 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.52) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.14) at 3- and 5- years. For local control rates the RR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.05) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.05) at 3- and 5- years; with a RR of 1.09 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.43) for locoregional recurrence, 0.79 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.53) for local and distant recurrence, 2.23 (95% CI 0.78 to 6.34) for para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and 0.99 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.35) for distance metastasis. For bladder, rectosigmoid and small bowel complications, the RR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.34), 1.00 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.91) and 3.37 (95% CI 1.06 to 10.72) respectively. These results indicated that there were no significant differences except for increased small bowel complications with HDRs (P = 0.04). Since the last version of this review, no new studies were identified for inclusion in this review to provide additional information. This review showed no significant differences between HDR and LDR ICBT when considering OS, DSS, RFS, local control rate, recurrence, metastasis and treatment related complications for women with cervical carcinoma. Due to some potential advantages of HDR ICBT (rigid immobilization, outpatient treatment, patient convenience, accuracy of source and applicator positioning, individualized treatment) we recommend the use of HDR ICBT for all clinical stages of cervix cancer. The overall risk of bias was high for the included studies as many of the items were either of high or unclear risk. The GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence was low to moderate.","Four studies involving 1265 women were included in our meta-analysis to compare HDR and LDR ICBT. The pooled results indicated there were no significant difference with regard to 3-, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates; 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates; 3- and 5-year relapse-free survival; 3- and 5-year local control rates; and local and distant recurrence. Only in respect to complications did HDR ICBTshow mildly increased numbers of small bowel complications. These results confirmed that there were no significant differences in the efficacy and safety of HDR versus LDR ICBT for women with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. We included three randomised controlled trials and one quasi-randomised controlled trial. The way that randomisation was carried out was described in only two trials but they did not give details regarding allocation concealment and blinding. However, all trials had a low risk bias for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and selective reporting (reporting bias). The different methodological approaches used in the trials prevented any clear conclusion being reached regarding the quality of the evidence. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate."
CD010406,"This updated review includes 30 studies (one RCT with two arms and 29 observational studies) with a total of 99,224 participants. We included 19 studies in the original review (n = 3459), all of which were observational, with 13 studies included in the meta-analysis for mortality. We included 12 new studies in this update (one RCT and 11 observational studies), and excluded one study in the original review as it has been superceded by a more recent analysis. Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis (9536 individuals), of which 15 studied people infected with 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09). Data specific to mortality were of very low quality, based predominantly on observational studies, with inconsistent reporting of variables potentially associated with the outcomes of interest, differences between studies in the way in which they were conducted, and with the likelihood of potential confounding by indication. Reported doses of corticosteroids used were high, and indications for their use were not well reported. On meta-analysis, corticosteroid therapy was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 3.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.31 to 6.60; I2 = 68%; 15 studies). A similar increase in risk of mortality was seen in a stratified analysis of studies reporting adjusted estimates (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.24; I2 = 0%; 5 studies). An association between corticosteroid therapy and increased mortality was also seen on pooled analysis of six studies which reported adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.02; I2 = 69%). Increased odds of hospital-acquired infection related to corticosteroid therapy were found on pooled analysis of seven studies (pooled OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.95; I2 = 90%); all were unadjusted estimates, and we graded the data as of very low certainty. We found one RCT of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for treating people with community-acquired pneumonia, but the number of people with laboratory-confirmed influenza in the treatment and placebo arms was too small to draw conclusions regarding the effect of corticosteroids in this group, and we did not include it in our meta-analyses of observational studies. The certainty of the available evidence from observational studies was very low, with confounding by indication a major potential concern. Although we found that adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is associated with increased mortality, this result should be interpreted with caution. In the context of clinical trials of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in sepsis and pneumonia that report improved outcomes, including decreased mortality, more high-quality research is needed (both RCTs and observational studies that adjust for confounding by indication). The currently available evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids for people with influenza.","We searched for studies comparing additional steroid treatment with no additional steroid treatment in individuals with influenza. The evidence is current to 3 October 2018. We identified a total of 30 studies with 99,224 individuals; one of these studies was a clinical trial. The majority of studies investigated adults admitted to hospital with pandemic influenza in 2009 and 2010. We found one relevant clinical trial, but there were very few participants (n = 24) with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The certainty of the evidence available from existing observational studies was of very low. We found that people with influenza who received additional steroid treatment may have a greater risk of death compared to those who did not receive steroid treatment. Hospital-acquired infection was the main 'side effect' related to steroid treatment reported in the included studies; most studies reported a greater risk of hospital-acquired infection in the group treated with steroids. However, it was unclear whether patients with more severe influenza had been selected to receive steroid treatment. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether additional steroid treatment in people with influenza is truly harmful or not. Further clinical trials of additional steroids in the treatment of individuals with influenza are therefore warranted. In the meantime, the use of steroids in influenza remains a clinical judgement call. In the one controlled trial there were only 24 participants with confirmed influenza infection, and there was under-representation of the sickest patients in the intensive care unit and with sepsis. The rest of the evidence was from observational studies, and we classified the certainty of this evidence as very low. A major limitation was that the indications for corticosteroid therapy were not fully specified in many of the studies; corticosteroids may have been used as a final attempt in people with the most severe disease, or conversely they may have been used to treat less severe illnesses that occurred simultaneously such as asthma exacerbations. It was noted in some studies that there was high degree of association between the use of corticosteroids and the presence of potentially confounding factors such as disease severity and underlying illnesses, suggesting that confounding by the indication for corticosteroids was likely if not adjusted for when determining effect estimates. We noted inconsistent reporting of other important variables that may be related to influenza-related death across studies, including time to hospitalisation, the use and timing of antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and the type, dose, timing, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. Additionally, for studies in which this information was reported, there were differences between studies in the way that disease severity was measured, the time point at which death was assessed, and the proportions of cases and controls treated with antivirals and/or antibiotics and in the type, dose, timing, and duration of corticosteroid therapy."
CD005526,"We identified three trials with 390 patients that compared cyclosporin A versus placebo. Two of them were assessed methodologically adequate with low-bias risk. Cyclosporin A did not significantly reduce mortality risk (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.45), and mortality or liver transplantation (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.20). Cyclosporin A significantly improved pruritus (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.14), but not fatigue. Cyclosporin A significantly reduced alanine aminotransferase (WMD -41 U/L, 95% CI -63 to -18) and increased serum albumin level (WMD 1.66 g/L, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.05). Significantly more patients experienced adverse events in the cyclosporin A group than in the placebo group, especially renal dysfunction (Peto odds ratio 5.56, 95% CI 2.52 to 12.27) and hypertension (SMD 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48). We found no evidence supporting or refuting that cyclosporin A may delay death, death or liver transplantation, or progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. Cyclosporin A caused more adverse events than placebo, like renal dysfunction and hypertension. We do not recommend the use of cyclosporin A outside randomised clinical trials.","The findings in this review are based on three clinical trials with 390 patients. The drug cyclosporin A was tested against placebo. The primary findings of the review are that cyclosporin A has no effect on survival or progression of the disease (cirrhosis development). Patients given cyclosporin A experienced more adverse events than patients given placebo, especially renal dysfunction and hypertension. There was significant improvement in itching (pruritus) and liver biochemistry, which were secondary outcome measures. We cannot recommend the use of cyclosporin A outside randomised clinical trials."
CD004204,"We identified seven trials in which a total of 590 preterm infants participated. Most participants were clinically stable preterm infants of birth weight less than 1850 g. Few participants were extremely preterm, extremely low birth weight, or growth restricted at birth. Trials were conducted more than 30 years ago, were formula industry funded, and were small with methodological weaknesses (including lack of masking) that might bias effect estimates. Meta-analyses of in-hospital growth parameters were limited by statistical heterogeneity. There is no evidence of an effect on time to regain birth weight (MD -1.48 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.73 to 1.77) and low-certainty evidence suggests that feeding with nutrient-enriched formula increases in-hospital rates of weight gain (MD 2.43 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.26) and head circumference growth (MD 1.04 mm/week, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.89). Meta-analysis did not show an effect on the average rate of length gain (MD 0.22 mm/week, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.13). Fewer data are available for growth and developmental outcomes assessed beyond infancy, and these do not show consistent effects of nutrient-enriched formula feeding. Data from two trials did not show an effect on Bayley Mental Development Index scores at 18 months post term (MD 2.87, 95% CI -1.38 to 7.12; moderate-certainty evidence). Infants who received nutrient-enriched formula had higher Bayley Psychomotor Development Index scores at 18 months post term (MD 6.56. 95% CI 2.87 to 10.26; low-certainty evidence), but no evidence suggested an effect on cerebral palsy (typical RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.07; 2 studies, 377 infants). Available data did not indicate any other benefits or harms and provided low-certainty evidence about the effect of nutrient-enriched formula feeding on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants (typical RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25; 3 studies, 489 infants). Available trial data show that feeding preterm infants nutrient-enriched (compared with standard) formulas has only modest effects on growth rates during their initial hospital admission. No evidence suggests effects on long-term growth or development. The GRADE assessment indicates that the certainty of this evidence is low, and that these findings should be interpreted and applied with caution. Further randomised trials would be needed to resolve this uncertainty.",",and some were prone to bias. Nutrient-enriched versus standard formula for preterm infants does not reduce the time taken to regain birth weight but is associated with higher rates of weight gain and head growth (although not length gain) during neonatal unit stay after birth. Only limited data are available for growth and developmental outcomes assessed beyond infancy, and these do not show consistent effects. No evidence suggests other potential benefits or harms of nutrient-enriched formulas, including effects on feeding or bowel problems. Although available trial data show that nutrient-enriched formulas increase growth rates of preterm infants during their initial hospital admission, they do not provide evidence of effects on longer-term growth or development. Further randomised trials would be needed to resolve this uncertainty."
MR000051,"We identified eight eligible studies, which we grouped into five comparisons. 1. Risk-based versus extensive on-site monitoring: based on two large studies, we found moderate certainty of evidence for the combined primary outcome of major or critical findings that risk-based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on-site monitoring. Although the risk ratio was close to 'no difference' (1.03 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.81 to 1.33, below 1.0 in favor of the risk-based strategy), the high imprecision in one study and the small number of eligible studies resulted in a wide CI of the summary estimate. Low certainty of evidence suggested that monitoring strategies with extensive on-site monitoring were associated with considerably higher resource use and costs (up to a factor of 3.4). Data on recruitment or retention of trial participants were not available. 2. Central monitoring with triggered on-site visits versus regular on-site visits: combining the results of two eligible studies yielded low certainty of evidence with a risk ratio of 1.83 (95% CI 0.51 to 6.55) in favor of triggered monitoring intervention. Data on recruitment, retention, and resource use were not available. 3. Central statistical monitoring and local monitoring performed by site staff with annual on-site visits versus central statistical monitoring and local monitoring only: based on one study, there was moderate certainty of evidence that a small number of major and critical findings were missed with the central monitoring approach without on-site visits: 3.8% of participants in the group without on-site visits and 6.4% in the group with on-site visits had a major or critical monitoring finding (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7; P = 0.03). The absolute number of monitoring findings was very low, probably because defined major and critical findings were very study specific and central monitoring was present in both intervention groups. Very low certainty of evidence did not suggest a relevant effect on participant retention, and very low-quality evidence indicated an extra cost for on-site visits of USD 2,035,392. There were no data on recruitment. 4. Traditional 100% source data verification (SDV) versus targeted or remote SDV: the two studies assessing targeted and remote SDV reported findings only related to source documents. Compared to the final database obtained using the full SDV monitoring process, only a small proportion of remaining errors on overall data were identified using the targeted SDV process in the MONITORING study (absolute difference 1.47%, 95% CI 1.41% to 1.53%). Targeted SDV was effective in the verification of source documents but increased the workload on data management. The other included study was a pilot study which compared traditional on-site SDV versus remote SDV and found little difference in monitoring findings and the ability to locate data values despite marked differences in remote access in two clinical trial networks. There were no data on recruitment or retention. 5. Systematic on-site initiation visit versus on-site initiation visit upon request: very low certainty of evidence suggested no difference in retention and recruitment between the two approaches. There were no data on critical and major findings or on resource use. The evidence base is limited in terms of quantity and quality. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more prospective, comparative monitoring studies nested in clinical trials and measuring effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. However, the results suggesting risk-based, targeted, and mainly central monitoring as an efficient strategy are promising. The development of reliable triggers for on-site visits is ongoing; different triggers might be used in different settings. More evidence on risk indicators that identify sites with problems or the prognostic value of triggers is needed to further optimize central monitoring strategies. In particular, approaches with an initial assessment of trial-specific risks that need to be closely monitored centrally during trial conduct with triggered on-site visits should be evaluated in future research.","We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk-based monitoring versus extensive on-site monitoring found no evidence that the risk-based approach is inferior to extensive on-site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three- to five-fold higher with extensive on-site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on-site visits versus regular (untriggered) on-site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on-site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on-site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on-site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on-site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow-up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. We are moderately certain that risk-based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on-site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high-quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions."
CD003285,"Two randomised trials with a total of 161 participants were included in this review. The studies did not report on mortality and rate of limb loss. One randomised trial with a total of 133 participants showed that there was a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants who received folic acid compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.11, P < 0.001) and in participants who received 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) versus placebo (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10, P = 0.009). A second trial with a total of 18 participants showed that there was no difference (P non-significant) in ABI in participants who received a multivitamin B supplement (mean ± SEM: 0.7 ± 01) compared with placebo (mean ± SEM: 0.8 ± 0.1). No major events were reported. Currently, no recommendation can be made regarding the value of treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia in peripheral arterial disease. Further, well constructed trials are urgently required.",We looked at studies where treatments to lower homocysteine were used in people with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia. Two trials with 161 participants with PAD were included in this review. One trial showed a significant  improvement in the ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants treated daily with 400 μg folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). A second trial showed that there was no difference in ABI in participants who received a multivitamin B supplement compared with placebo. None of the other predefined primary outcomes (mortality and rate of limb loss) were assessed in these studies. More research about the effect of homocysteine lowering therapy on the clinical progression of disease in people with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia is needed.
CD006728,"Three high-quality and three low-quality studies, involving 519 people with depression, were identified. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments. Despite fairly good methodological quality and positive findings of some studies, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression did not exceed level 3 (limited or conflicting evidence), except for moderate evidence (level 2), based on the non-combined findings from three studies, indicating that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on decreasing depression, and on increasing family functioning. The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. Further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required.","This review looks at whether family therapy is an effective intervention in treating people of any age with depression. Family therapy for depression is widely used, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. The small number of randomised controlled trials included in the review were very heterogeneous, and therefore difficult to synthesise. Family therapy seems more effective than no treatment or being placed on a waiting list, but it remains unclear how effective this intervention is in comparison to other interventions. Further randomised controlled trials are needed."
CD007082,"We identified a total of 9188 citations and included 15 RCTs conducted on 2242 participants in this review. All trials used the LMA Classic in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II for patients undergoing elective general anaesthesia. Children were enrolled in 11 trials and adults in five trials. None of the trials were of high methodological quality. Eight of the 15 studies had adequate generation of random sequence, whereas only one trial had adequate concealment of random sequence. Three trials had blinded the outcome assessor. Thus, the majority of the studies appeared to have a high risk of bias in the study design. Using the GRADE approach, we found low quality evidence that the risk of laryngospasm was similar with early removal of the LMA (3.3%) versus late removal (2.7%): risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.03; 11 trials, 1615 participants. The quality of evidence was very low that the risk of coughing was less after early removal (13.9%) than late removal (19.4%): RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.94; 11 trials, 1430 participants. The quality of evidence for the risk of desaturation was also very low; there was no difference between early removal (7.9%) and late removal (10.1%): RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.16; 13 trials, 2037 participants. We found low quality evidence that the risk of airway obstruction was higher with early removal (15.6%) compared to late removal of the LMA (4.6%): RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.5; eight trials, 1313 participants. This systematic review suggests that current best evidence comparing early versus late removal of the LMA in participants undergoing general anaesthesia does not demonstrate superiority of either intervention. However, the quality of evidence available is either low or very low. There is a paucity of well designed RCTs and a need for large scale RCTs to demonstrate whether early removal or late removal of the LMA is better after general anaesthesia.","The evidence is current to August 2014. We found 15 randomized controlled trials on 2242 participants addressing this question. All the trials were performed in individuals who were not seriously ill under elective general anaesthesia. A LMA Classic was used for all studies. Children were enrolled in 11 studies and adults in five studies. None of the trials were of high methodological quality. The risks of complications such as laryngospasm (tight closure of the windpipe preventing effective breathing), and lowering of oxygen content in the blood (desaturation), were similar with early removal and late removal of the LMA. Coughing was less frequent after early removal of the LMA, with a risk of 13.9% as compared to the risk of 19.4% after late removal of the LMA. However, airway obstruction was more likely after early removal, with a risk of 15.6%, as compared to a risk of 4.6% after late removal of the LMA. No data were available on length of stay in the recovery room or hospital, or patient satisfaction. Thus, overall, this systematic review suggests that with the current available evidence, early and late removal of the LMA are comparable in persons undergoing general anaesthesia, and neither is superior in terms of safety. The quality of the evidence that is available is either low or very low for all the outcomes described. This was mainly due to poorly conducted studies, the small number of people that they recruited, and to a lesser extent, some variation in the study results."
CD005304,"We included one RCT that compared nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) with placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection. We assessed it to be a RCT with overall low risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion cough-free at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 5.14). However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.83, P = 0.02). The mean change in daytime cough diary scores from baseline was also better in the placebo group compared to those on nebulised rhDNase, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (MD 0.70; 95% CI -0.19 to 1.59). Other outcomes (dyspnoea, and difficulty in expectorating sputum scores, and lung function tests at two weeks also favoured placebo over nebulised rhDNase but did not reach levels of significance. There is currently an absence of evidence to support any of the therapies currently utilised for management of intrinsic tracheomalacia. It remains inconclusive whether the use of nebulised rhDNase in children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection worsens recovery. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are clearly needed. Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes.","We wanted to find out which out of these possible treatments was most effective. We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) which helps in breaking down the mucous and has been shown to be useful in aiding airway clearance in cystic fibrosis compared to placebo (no active treatment) in children with both tracheomalacia and a concurrent respiratory infection. This trial showed no evidence of benefit in terms of the number of children who were cough-free two weeks after treatment. Also, there was less coughing reported, both during the day and at night, in the group who did not receive the intervention - however these differences were not statistically significant. With the lack of evidence, the routine use of any therapies for intrinsic tracheomalacia cannot be recommended given the cost of nebulised rhDNase and the likely harmful effect. The decision to subject a child to any surgical or medical based therapies will have to be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for each individual situation. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are needed."
CD003313,"Nine studies with 658 infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Term and preterm infants with Rh or ABO (or both) incompatibility were included. The use of exchange transfusion decreased significantly in the immunoglobulin treated group (typical RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.49; typical RD -0.22, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.16; NNTB 5). The mean number of exchange transfusions per infant was also significantly lower in the immunoglobulin treated group (MD -0.34, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.17). However, sensitivity analysis by risk of bias showed that in the only two studies in which the treatment was masked by use of a placebo and outcome assessment was blinded, the results differed; there was no difference in the need for exchange transfusions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.98) or number of exchange transfusions (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.10). Two studies assessed long-term outcomes and found no cases of kernicterus, deafness or cerebral palsy. Although overall results show a significant reduction in the need for exchange transfusion in infants treated with IVIg, the applicability of the results is limited because of low to very low quality of evidence. Furthermore, the two studies at lowest risk of bias show no benefit of IVIg in reducing the need for and number of exchange transfusions. Based on these results, we have insufficient confidence in the effect estimate for benefit of IVIg to make even a weak recommendation for the use of IVIg for the treatment of alloimmune HDN. Further studies are needed before the use of IVIg for the treatment of alloimmune HDN can be recommended, and should include blinding of the intervention by use of a placebo as well as sufficient sample size to assess the potential for serious adverse effects.","We searched the medical literature to 19 May 2017 and found nine randomized (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) or partly (quasi) randomized trials (including 658 participants) that assessed the efficiency of IVIg in infants with alloimmune HDN. Analysis of all included studies showed a reduction in the need for and number of ETs in infants treated with IVIg combined with phototherapy compared to infants treated with phototherapy only. However, this was not confirmed in an analysis of the two placebo-controlled studies (where a pretend treatment was given). There was no difference in the need for or number of top-up transfusions. The evidence from the studies was very low quality. However, two studies used a placebo, thereby minimizing bias and allowing blinding of the researchers assessing the response. These studies were consistent with each other and yielded moderate quality evidence (with a relatively small total number of participants involved (172) being the only reason to not regard the level of evidence from them as high) that IVIg was ineffective in preventing ET or top-up transfusions. Based on all included studies, we could make no conclusions on the benefit of IVIg in preventing ET or top-up transfusion. However, the two placebo-controlled trials provided evidence of moderate quality that IVIg was ineffective in preventing ET or top-up transfusion, and therefore routine use in alloimmune HDN should not be recommended. However, since there was some evidence that IVIg reduced hemolysis (in laboratory studies), future high-quality studies are needed to determine whether IVIg has limited role in some infants with alloimmune HDN."
CD010431,"We included eight trials, which randomised 365 participants. The trials all used a split-mouth design, some with more than one pair of lesions treated within the same participant. Studies took place in university or dental public health clinics in Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Thailand, Greenland and Chile. Six studies evaluated the effects of micro-invasive treatments in the permanent dentition and two studies on the primary dentition, with caries risk ranging from low to high. Investigators measured caries risk in different studies either by caries experience alone or by using the Cariogram programme, which combines eight contributing factors, including caries experience, diet, saliva and other factors related to caries. The follow-up period in the trials ranged from one to three years. All studies used lesion progression as the primary outcome, evaluating it by different methods of reading radiographs. Four studies received industry support to carry out the research, with one of them being carried out by inventors of the intervention. We judged seven studies to be at high overall risk of bias, primarily due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. We evaluated intervention effects for all micro-invasive therapies and analysed subgroups according to the different treatment methods reported in the included studies. Our meta-analysis, which pooled the most sensitive set of data (in terms of measurement method) from studies presenting data in a format suitable for meta-analysis, showed that micro-invasive treatment significantly reduced the odds of lesion progression compared with non-invasive treatment (e.g fluoride varnish) or oral hygiene advice (e.g to floss) (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.41; 602 lesions; seven studies; I2 = 32%). There was no evidence of subgroup differences (P = 0.36). The four studies that measured adverse events reported no adverse events after micro-invasive treatment. Most studies did not report on any further outcomes. We assessed the quality of evidence for micro-invasive treatments as moderate. It remains unclear which micro-invasive treatment is more advantageous, or if certain clinical conditions or patient characteristics are better suited for micro-invasive treatments than others. The available evidence shows that micro-invasive treatment of proximal caries lesions arrests non-cavitated enamel and initial dentinal lesions (limited to outer third of dentine, based on radiograph) and is significantly more effective than non-invasive professional treatment (e.g. fluoride varnish) or advice (e.g. to floss). We can be moderately confident that further research is unlikely to substantially change the estimate of effect. Due to the small number of studies, it does remain unclear which micro-invasive technique offers the greatest benefit, or whether the effects of micro-invasive treatment confer greater or lesser benefit according to different clinical or patient considerations.","This review ​considered evidence that was up to date at 31 December 2014. We found eight relevant trials with 365 participants. These trials involved children and adults whose decay lesions (tooth decay) were randomly assigned to different micro-invasive and non-invasive treatments. There were no studies comparing micro-invasive interventions with invasive treatment (fillings). Four studies received financial support from intervention inventors or manufacturers to carry out the research. The current evidence shows that micro-invasive treatments can significantly reduce the likelihood of dental decay progression compared with the described non-invasive methods. There are too few studies to decide which micro-invasive treatment technique is best or the impact of different clinical and patient considerations. No negative side effects were reported; however, only half of the studies measured this outcome and the follow-up time of some of the studies was relatively short. Although further research could possibly change our findings, the available evidence gives us moderate confidence that micro-invasive treatments are much more effective than non-invasive treatments for stopping tooth decay."
CD006063,"Eighteen trials which randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone treatment were identified. Longest duration of therapy was four years with a median of 26 weeks. Published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by this compound. Metabolic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint did not demonstrate clinically relevant differences to other oral antidiabetic drugs. Occurrence of oedema was significantly raised (OR 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.81). The single large RCT (ADOPT - A Diabetes Outcomes Progression Trial) indicated increased cardiovascular risk. New data on raised fracture rates in women reveal extensive action of rosiglitazone in various body tissues. New studies should focus on patient-oriented outcomes to clarify the benefit-risk ratio of rosiglitazone therapy. Safety data and adverse events of all investigations (published and unpublished) should be made available to the public.","Eighteen trials randomised 3888 people to rosiglitazone therapy. The longest duration of rosiglitazone treatment was four years, most trials lasted around half a year. Unfortunately, the published studies of at least 24 weeks rosiglitazone treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus did not provide relevant evidence that patient-oriented outcomes are positively influenced by this agent. The chance of developing oedema was approximately doubled, the risk of cardiovascular diseases increased. The single large randomised controlled trial showed evidence of raised cardiovascular risk after rosiglitazone treatment. Moreover, new safety data show increased numbers of broken bones in women. This finding was published years after approval of this agent by drug regulatory authorities. New ways of exploring drug effects, for example by early long-term studies in many people, as well as public access to all safety data of published and unpublished investigations have to be established."
CD004312,"We included one RCT of moderate overall risk of bias (as multiple domains were at unclear risk of bias), which included 66 BtA-naive participants with cervical dystonia. Two doses of BtA (Dysport; week 0 and 8; mean dose 262 to 292 U) were compared with daily trihexyphenidyl (up to 24 mg daily). The trial was sponsored by the BtA producer. BtA reduced cervical dystonia severity by an average of 2.5 points (95% CI 0.68 to 4.32) on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) severity subscale 12 weeks after injection, compared to trihexyphenidyl. More participants reported adverse events in the trihexyphenidyl treatment group (76 events), compared with the BtA group (31 events); however, the difference in dropouts due to adverse events was inconclusive between groups. There was a decreased risk of dry mouth, and memory problems with BtA, but the differences were inconclusive between groups for the other reported side effects (blurred vision, dizziness, depression, fatigue, pain at injection site, dysphagia, and neck weakness). We found very low-certainty evidence that BtA is more effective, better tolerated, and safer than trihexyphenidyl. We found no information on a dose-response relationship with BtA, differences between BtA formulations or different anticholinergics, the utility of electromyography-guided injections, or the duration of treatment effect.","We searched the medical literature to July 2020. We found one study that compared treatment with BtA (Dysport) versus an anticholinergic drug (trihexyphenidyl) for 12 weeks. The study included 66 participants, who had experienced cervical dystonia for an average of 9.4 years, but had never received BtA treatment. On average, they had moderate impairment. The average age of people in the study was 50.7 years. The trial was funded by the BtA drug manufacturer. The results show that Dysport, when compared with trihexyphenidyl, may improve symptoms of cervical dystonia, pain, and quality of life. The risk of having an unpleasant or undesirable event, particularly dry mouth and memory issues, was increased in people taking trihexyphenidyl. We found no information on the effects of different doses of BtA, different formulas of BtA or types of anticholinergics, the usefulness of guiding injections by electromyography, or how long the effects lasted. Due to limitations in the study methods and size of the study, we have very little confidence in the results. These conclusions may not apply to all people with cervical dystonia. They do not apply to long-term use of either treatment."
CD003422,"Only three trials, involving 189 participants, satisfied the inclusion criteria and these were of low methodological quality. One study showed a significant difference in hearing recovery in the vasodilator group (carbogen combined with a course of several other drugs) compared to the control group (a course of several other drugs alone). Another study only showed a significant improvement in higher frequencies in the vasodilator group (prostaglandin E1 + steroid) compared with the control group (placebo and steroid), no difference having been shown in overall hearing gain. In the third study the vasodilator group (naftidrofuryl and low-molecular weight dextran) showed an improvement only in lower frequencies over the control group (placebo and low-molecular weight dextran). Two of the studies reported adverse effects from vasodilator treatment, whereas there was no mention of any side effects in the third. Five patients in one study developed a sensation of heaviness in the head which settled spontaneously and did not interfere with treatment. In the other study one patient developed an allergic reaction and had to be excluded from the study. The effectiveness of vasodilators in the treatment of ISSHL remains unproven. The included studies were of relatively poor quality and the number of patients included was small. Moreover, there were differences in the type, dosage and duration of vasodilator used in each study. Due to the degree of heterogeneity the results could not be combined to reach a conclusion.","We found three trials, involving 189 participants, which showed improvement in hearing thresholds in those treated with vasodilators compared to control groups.

The effectiveness of vasodilators in the treatment of ISSHL could not be proven. Further research is needed."
CD003265,"Thirteen studies (2032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcome measures were not interpretable because of underlying heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses suggested that methenamine hippurate may have some benefit in patients without renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.89; bacteriuria: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83), but not in patients with known renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 6.20; bacteriuria: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.07). For short-term treatment duration (1 week or less) there was a significant reduction in symptomatic UTI in those without renal tract abnormalities (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38). The rate of adverse events was low. Methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities, particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis. It does not appear to work in patients with neuropathic bladder or in patients who have renal tract abnormalities. The rate of adverse events was low, but poorly described. There is a need for further large well-conducted RCTs to clarify this question, particularly for longer term use for people without neuropathic bladder.",This review identified 13 studies (2032 participants). Methenamine hippurate may be effective in preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities particularly when used for short term prophylaxis. It does not appear to be effective for long term prophylaxis in patients who have neuropathic bladder. There were few adverse effects.Additional well controlled randomised controlled trials are necessary in particular to clarify effectiveness for longer term prophylaxis in those without neuropathic bladder.
CD012829,"We included nine studies involving 436,684 patients and family members and one ongoing study. The published studies focused on patients with specific conditions such as coronary artery disease, ischaemic stroke, and asthma, as well as pregnant women, inpatients on medical surgical wards, older adults and high-risk patients with a history of poor self-management. While all studies tested interventions versus usual care, for four studies the usual care group also received educational or information strategies. Seven of the interventions involved face-to-face, interactional education/coaching sessions aimed at patients/families while two provided multi-component education programmes which included components targeted at staff as well as patients/families. All of the interventions included: (1) an educational component about the acute condition and preparedness for future events such as stroke or change in fetal movements: (2) an engagement element (self-monitoring, action plans); while two additionally focused on shared language or communication skills. We had concerns about risk of bias for all but one of the included studies in respect of one or more criteria, particularly regarding blinding of participants and personnel. Our confidence in results regarding the effectiveness of interventions was moderate to low. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may be moderate improvement in patients’ knowledge of acute life-threatening conditions, danger signs, appropriate care-seeking responses, and preparedness capacity between interactional patient-facing interventions and multi-component programmes and usual care at 12 months (MD 4.20, 95% CI 2.44 to 5.97, 2 studies, 687 participants). Four studies in total assessed knowledge (3,086 participants) but we were unable to include two other studies in the pooled analysis due to differences in the way outcome measures were reported. One found no improvement in knowledge but higher symptom preparedness at 12 months. The other study found an improvement in patients’ knowledge about symptoms and appropriate care-seeking responses in the intervention group at 18 months compared with usual care. Low-certainty evidence from two studies, each using a different measure, meant that we were unable to determine the effects of patient-based interventions on self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was higher in the intervention group in one study but there was no difference in the other compared with usual care. We are uncertain whether interactional patient-facing and multi-component programmes improve time from the start of patient symptoms to treatment due to low-certainty evidence for this outcome. We were unable to combine the data due to differences in outcome measures. Three studies found that arrival times or prehospital delay time was no different between groups. One found that delay time was shorter in the intervention group. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that multi-component interventions probably have little or no impact on mortality rates. Only one study on a pregnant population was eligible for inclusion in the review, which found no difference between groups in rates of stillbirth. In terms of unintended events, we found that interactional patient-facing interventions to increase patient and family involvement in escalation of care probably have few adverse effects on patient's anxiety levels (moderate-certainty evidence). None of the studies measured or reported patient and family perceptions of involvement in escalation of care or patient and family experience of patient care. Reported outcomes related to healthcare professionals were also not reported in any studies. Our review identified that interactional patient-facing interventions and multi-component programmes (including staff) to increase patient and family involvement in escalation of care for acute life-threatening illness may improve patient and family knowledge about danger signs and care-seeking responses, and probably have few adverse effects on patient’s anxiety levels when compared to usual care. Multi-component interventions probably have little impact on mortality rates. Further high-quality trials are required using multi-component interventions and a focus on relational elements of care. Cognitive and behavioural outcomes should be included at patient and staff level.","We found nine relevant studies in different healthcare settings in which 436,684 patients and family members took part. Seven of the strategies studied involved face-to-face education or coaching sessions for patients and families, and two involved education programmes aimed at healthcare staff as well as patients and their families. All strategies had an educational part and an engagement part (for example, self-monitoring; using action plans); two strategies additionally focused on communication skills and using shared language. All studies compared usual care against receiving strategies to increase involvement of patients and their families in seeking emergency care. In four studies, people in the usual care group also received information or educational strategies. The studies varied in design and in their assessments, making it difficult to compare all their results. We did not find any studies that looked at patients', or their families', satisfaction with care, or what they thought of their involvement in seeking emergency care. Compared with usual care, strategies to improve involvement in securing emergency care:
- may help patients and their families to know which danger signs to look for, and to know the right action to take (4 studies; 3086 people);
- probably have little to no effect on stillbirth in pregnancy (1 study; 409,175 people); and
- probably do not increase anxiety levels in patients and their families (1 study; 2,597 people). We are uncertain if the strategies affected:
- peoples' confidence in recognising and reporting worsening in a health condition (2 studies; 217 people); or
- the time between the start of life-threatening symptoms and receiving emergency treatment (4 studies; 27,023 people). We are moderately confident about the effect of the strategies on anxiety levels and on stillbirth, although these results might change with further evidence. We are less confident about our other findings, which are likely to change with further evidence. Some of the studies we compared had small numbers of people taking part, so their results may have been unreliable. Strategies to help patients and their families to secure emergency care may improve their knowledge about life-threatening conditions, and probably don't increase their anxiety more than usual care"
CD004122,"We included 11 new studies in this update resulting in a total of 19 randomised and 6 quasi-randomised trials (8919 participants). Clipping compared with no hair removal
Low certainty evidence suggests there may be little difference in risk of SSI when no hair removal is compared with hair removal using clippers (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.39; three studies with 1733 participants). Shaving with a razor compared with no hair removal
Moderate certainty evidence suggests the risk of SSI is probably increased in participants who have hair removal with a razor compared with no removal (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.14; seven studies with 1706 participants). In terms of absolute risk this represents 17 more SSIs per 1000 in the razor group compared with the no hair removal group (95% CI 1 more to 45 more SSI in the razor group). Based on low-certainty evidence, it is unclear whether there is a difference in stitch abscesses between hair removal with a razor and no hair removal (1 trial with 80 participants; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66). Based on narrative data from one trial with 136 participants, there may be little difference in length of hospital stay between participants having hair removed with a razor compared with those having no hair removal (low-certainty evidence). Based on narrative data from one trial with 278 participants, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in cost between participants having hair removed by shaving with a razor compared with no hair removal (very low certainty evidence). Depilatory cream compared with no hair removal
Low certainty evidence suggests there may be little difference in SSI risk between depilatory cream or no hair removal, although there are were wide confidence intervals around the point estimate that included benefit and harm (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.31; low-certainty evidence; 1 trial with 267 participants). Based on narrative data from one trial with 267 participants, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in cost between participants having hair removed with depilatory cream compared with no hair removal (very low certainty evidence). Shaving with a razor compared with clipping
Moderate-certainty evidence from 7 studies with 3723 participants suggests the risk of SSI is probably increased by shaving with a razor compared with clipping (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.33). Moderate-certainty evidence suggests the risk of skin injury is probably increased in people who have hair removal with a razor rather than clipping (3 trials with 1333 participants; RR 1.74, CI 95% 1.12 to 2.71). Shaving with a razor compared with depilatory cream
Moderate-certainty evidence from 9 studies with 1593 participants suggests there is probably more SSI risk when razors are used compared with depilatory cream (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.65). Low-certainty evidence suggests the risk of skin injury may be increased when using a razor rather than depilatory cream for hair removal (RR 6.95, CI 95% 3.45 to 13.98; 5 trials with 937 participants). Based on narrative data from three trials with 402 participants, it is uncertain whether depilatory cream is more expensive than shaving (very low certainty evidence). Hair removal on the day of surgery compared with one-day preoperatively
Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may be a small reduction in SSI risk when hair is removed on the day of surgery compared with the day before surgery although there are were wide confidence intervals around the point estimate that included benefit and harm (one trial, 977 participants; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30). Compared with no hair removal, there may be little difference in risk of SSI when clippers or depilatory cream are used (low-certainty evidence). However, there are probably fewer SSIs when hair is not removed compared with shaving with a razor (moderate-certainty evidence). If hair has to be removed, moderate-certainty evidence suggests using clippers or depilatory cream probably results in fewer SSIs and other complications compared with shaving using a razor. There may be a small reduction in SSIs when hair is removed on the day of, rather than the day before, surgery.","We wanted to find out if removing hair before surgery:
· causes or prevents infections;
· prevents wound complications, such as cuts to the skin or the opening up of stitched wounds;
· has an impact on how long people stay in hospital after surgery; and
· has any cost implications. We were also interested in whether some hair removal methods or times for hair removal are better than others. First, we searched for studies that compared:
· hair removal against no removal; or
· different methods and times of hair removal. We then compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 25 studies that involved a total of 8919 people. Ten studies compared no hair removal against hair removal, using:
· clippers (3 studies);
· shaving with a razor (8 studies, 7 of which provided useable evidence); or
· hair removal cream (1 study). Seven studies compared using a razor against using clippers, and 10 studies compared using a razor against using cream (nine of these 10 studies provided useable evidence). One study compared hair removal the day before surgery versus hair removal on the day of surgery. Hair removal compared to no hair removal
· Hair removal with clippers and cream may make little to no difference to the number of surgical site infections. · Hair removal with a razor probably risks more infections than no hair removal. Whether hair is removed with a razor or not removed may make little to no difference for length of hospital stay (1 study). Comparisons of different hair removal methods
· Clippers probably cause fewer infections and skin injuries than razors. · Cream probably causes fewer infections, and may cause fewer skin injuries, than razors. Time of hair removal
Whether hair is removed on the day of surgery or the day before surgery may slightly reduce infection numbers (1 study). Due to a lack of robust studies, we do not know:
· if removing hair affects wound complications and costs when compared to not removing hair;
· if different hair removal methods have different effects on length of hospital stay, or on costs; and
· if the time of hair removal affects wound complications, length of hospital stay, or costs. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019."
CD012256,"We included nine studies in this review. Eight studies involved 485 participants with CD. We assessed six of the studies to be at high risk of bias, and two to be at low risk of bias. We judged one study on RPD with 72 randomised participants to be at high risk of bias. Overall, the quality of the evidence for each comparison and outcome was either low or very low, therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, as future research is likely to change the findings. Complete dentures
Two studies compared the same material and different techniques (one study contributed data to a secondary outcome only); two studies compared the same technique and different materials; and four studies compared different materials and techniques. One study (10 participants) evaluated two stage–two step, Biofunctional Prosthetic system (BPS) using additional silicone elastomer compared to conventional methods, and found no evidence of a clear difference for oral health-related quality of life, or quality of the dentures (denture satisfaction). The study reported that BPS required fewer adjustments. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. One study (27 participants) compared selective pressure final-impression technique using wax versus polysulfide elastomeric (rubber) material. The study did not measure quality of life or dentures, and found no evidence of a clear difference between interventions in the need for adjustments (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.70). We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. One study compared two stage–two step final impression with alginate versus silicone elastomer. Oral health-related quality of life measured by the OHIP-EDENT seemed to be better with silicone (MD 7.20, 95% CI 2.71 to 11.69; 144 participants). The study found no clear differences in participant-reported quality of the denture (comfort) after a two-week 'confirmation' period, but reported that silicone was better for stability and chewing efficiency. We assessed the quality of the evidence as low. Three studies compared single-stage impressions with alginate versus two stage-two step with elastomer (silicone, polysulfide, or polyether) impressions. There was no evidence of a clear difference in the OHIP-EDENT at one month (MD 0.05, 95% CI -2.37 to 2.47; two studies, 98 participants). There was no evidence of a clear difference in participant-rated general satisfaction with dentures at six months (MD 0.00, 95% CI -8.23 to 8.23; one study, 105 participants). We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. One study compared single-stage alginate versus two stage-two step using zinc-oxide eugenol, and found no evidence of a clear difference in OHIP-EDENT (MD 0.50, 95% CI -2.67 to 3.67; 39 participants), or general satisfaction (RR 3.15, 95% CI 0.14 to 72.88; 39 participants) at six months. We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low. Removable partial dentures
One study randomised 72 participants and compared altered-cast technique versus one-piece cast technique. The study did not measure quality of life, but reported that most participants were satisfied with the dentures and there was no evidence of any clear difference between groups for general satisfaction at one-year follow-up (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a clear difference in number of intaglio adjustments at one year (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.34) (very low-quality evidence). We conclude that there is no clear evidence that one technique or material has a substantial advantage over another for making complete dentures and removable partial dentures. Available evidence for the relative benefits of different denture fabrication techniques and final-impression materials is limited and is of low or very low quality. More high-quality RCTs are required.","The evidence in this review is current to 22 November 2017. We found eight studies with a total of 485 participants for complete dentures, and one study with 72 participants for removable partial dentures. The participants ranged from 45 to 75 years old, and had been without their teeth for 10 to 35 years. The studies compared different materials used to make the final impression for dentures (alginate, zinc-oxide eugenol, wax, and addtional silicone, polysulfide or polyether) and different techniques for making the final impression (open-mouth versus closed-mouth, single-stage versus two stage-two step), or both. For most comparisons and outcomes, there was no evidence of a clear difference between the techniques or materials compared. Very low quality-evidence from one study (10 participants) suggested that making dentures with an additional silicone elastomer biofunctional prosthetic required fewer adjustments than conventional methods. Low-quality evidence from another study (144 participants) suggested that complete dentures made with silicone elastomer in a two stage–two step final impression, may be better than those made with alginate, in terms of oral health-related quality of life, stability of the denture, and chewing efficiency. With the limited evidence available, we are unable to draw any conclusions about the best impression techniques and materials for complete and partial removable dentures. There is a need for further research in this area. The quality of the evidence base overall is low to very low. Only one or two studies assessed each intervention and comparison, and most of the studies were at high risk of bias. Many of the studies did not measure our key outcomes. For both complete and partial removable dentures, we conclude that we have no reliable findings."
CD009146,"Two trials with 49 participants were included. One trial had low risk of bias. The other trial had high risk of bias. Hormone replacement had no effect on all-cause mortality (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.11, I² = 0%) and fractures (RD -0.08; 95% CI -0.24 to 0.07, I² = 0%). Hormone replacement significantly increased adverse events and number of patients having hormone replacement withdrawn due to adverse events (RR 5.26; 95% CI 1.26 to 22.04, I² = 0%). Hormone replacement had no significant effect on lumbar spine bone mineral density (MD 1.25 g/cm² yearֿ¹; 95% CI -0.91 to 3.42, I² = 0%). On the other hand, a significant increase in proximal femur bone mineral density was observed in the control group (MD 2.24 g/cm² yearֿ¹; 95% CI 0.74 to 3.74, I² = 0%). Hormone replacement had no significant effect on liver-related mortality, liver transplantation, or liver-related morbidity. Hormone replacement had no significant effect on serum bilirubin concentration (MD 4.60 µmol/L; 95% CI -3.42 to 12.62, I² = 0%). We did not find evidence to support the use of hormone replacement for women with primary biliary cirrhosis. It seems that hormone replacement is connected with a significant increase in the occurrence of adverse events.",This review assessed the effect of hormone replacement on treatment of osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. We found no evidence of effect of hormone replacement on mortality and fractures in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. It seems that hormone replacement given to women with primary biliary cirrhosis is connected with a significant increase in the occurrence of adverse events compared with placebo or no intervention. Hormone replacement appears to have no effect on the lumbar bone mineral density compared with placebo or no intervention. Hormone replacement may decrease bone mineral density measured at the proximal femur. We did not find evidence to support the use of hormone replacement for osteoporosis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis.
CD010395,"A total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies took place in high-income countries. The effect of the interventions on cardiovascular fitness at one year (two studies; 444 participants) was positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity of the observed effects (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76; high quality evidence). The effect of the interventions on self-reported PA at one year (nine studies; 4547 participants) was positive and moderate (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.28; moderate quality evidence) with heterogeneity (I2 = 37%) in the observed effects. One study reported positive results at two years (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.32; moderate quality evidence). When studies were stratified by risk of bias, the studies at low risk of bias (eight studies; 3403 participants) had an increased effect (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.40; moderate quality evidence). The most effective interventions applied a tailored approach to the type of PA and used telephone contact to provide feedback and to support changes in PA levels. There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (seven studies; 2892 participants). Risk of bias was assessed as low (eight studies; 3060 participants) or moderate (three studies; 2677 participants). There were no differences in effectiveness between studies using different types of professionals delivering the intervention (for example health professional, exercise specialist). There was no difference in pooled estimates between studies that generated the prescribed PA using an automated computer programme versus a human, nor between studies that used pedometers as part of their intervention compared to studies that did not. We found consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting PA. These interventions have positive, moderate sized effects on increasing self-reported PA and measured cardio-respiratory fitness, at least at 12 months. The effectiveness of these interventions was supported by moderate and high quality studies. However, there continues to be a paucity of cost effectiveness data and studies that include participants from varying socioeconomic or ethnic groups. To better understand the independent effect of individual programme components, longer term studies, with at least one year follow-up, are required.","We included a total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults in this review. The findings of the review indicate that using technologies to support adults' attempts to become more active, achieve the recommended weekly amounts of activity, or become fitter are successful. Changes can be achieved with help from a trained professional and through personal support via telephone, e-mail, or written information. New physical activity can be maintained for at least one year and it does not increase the risk of falls or exercise related injuries. More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active in the long term."
CD012501,"Fifty trials (19 RCTs and 31 before-and-after studies) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of cerivastatin in 12,877 participants who had their LDL cholesterol measured. The participants were of any age with and without cardiovascular disease and the trials studied cerivastatin effects within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks. Cerivastatin 0.025 mg/day to 0.8 mg/day caused LDL cholesterol decreases of 11.0% to 40.8%, total cholesterol decreases of 8.0% to 28.8% and triglyceride decreases of 9.0% to 21.4%. We judged the certainty of evidence for these effects to be high. Log dose-response data over doses of 2.5 mg to 80 mg revealed strong linear dose-related effects on LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. When compared to fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing LDL cholesterol; 233-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 18-fold more potent than atorvastatin and six-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing total cholesterol; and 125-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 11-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 13-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing triglycerides. There was no dose-related effect of cerivastatin on HDL cholesterol, but overall cerivastatin increased HDL cholesterol by 5%. There was a high risk of bias for the outcome withdrawals due to adverse effects, but a low risk of bias for the lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not different between cerivastatin and placebo in 11 of 19 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.74). The LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride lowering effect of cerivastatin was linearly dependent on dose. Cerivastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin in reducing LDL cholesterol, and 233-fold greater potency than fluvastatin, 18-fold greater potency than atorvastatin and six-fold greater potency than rosuvastatin at reducing total cholesterol. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with cerivastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 42% of the RCTs.","We looked for high quality randomised trials (RCTs) and before-and-after studies with cerivastatin in different dose sizes . The trials were between three and twelve weeks long. People of any age and gender, either with or without heart disease were in these trials. Participants could be of any age and gender, with or without cardiovascular disease. We found fifty trials with 13,018 participants who had their lipid levels measured. 12,877 participants had their LDL cholesterol measured. People taking 0.025 to 0.8 mg of cerivastatin per day lowered their LDL cholesterol by 12% to 42%. The higher the dose, the lower the levels of three measures of cholesterol. HDL cholesterol increased by 5%. For lowering LDL cholesterol, cerivastatin is 250-times stronger than fluvastatin, 20-times stronger than atorvastatin and 5.5 times stronger than rosuvastatin. Only 11 of the 19 RCTs reported the number of people who dropped out of the studies because of adverse effects. The level of drop outs due to adverse effects were similar in the people who took cerivastatin and placebo. There is a high level of trust around the results  for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and very low to moderate for triglycerides. We have a low level of trust in the evidence around drop outs because many (8 out of 19 trials) did not report drop outs due to adverse effects."
CD002945,"Four studies involving 127,891 men and 9342 women were included in this review. Only one study included women. Results for men and women were analysed separately. Three to five years after screening there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between screened and unscreened groups for men or women (men, odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.07; for women OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21). There was a significant decrease in mortality from AAA in men (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78), but not for women (OR 1.99; 95% CI 0.36 to 10.88). In this analysis mortality includes death from rupture and from emergency or elective surgery for aneurysm repair. There was also a decreased incidence of ruptured aneurysm in men (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.99) but not in women (OR 1.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 8.94). There was a significant increase in surgery for AAA in men (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.59 to 2.59). This was not reported in women. There were no data on life expectancy, complications of surgery or subjective quality of life. There is evidence of a significant reduction in mortality from AAA in men aged 65 to 79 years who undergo ultrasound screening. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit in women. The cost effectiveness may be acceptable, but needs further expert analysis. These findings need careful consideration in judging whether a co-ordinated population-based screening programme should be introduced.","This review identified four controlled trials involving 127,891 men and 9342 women who were randomly assigned to aortic aneurysm screening using ultrasound or no screening. Only one trial included women. Two of the trials were conducted in the UK, one in Denmark and one in Australia. The results provide evidence of a benefit from screening in men with a strongly significant reduction in deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysm. The odds ratio (OR) for death was 0.60 (range 0.47 to 0.78, three trials) in men aged 65 to 83 years but was not reduced for women. From one trial there was also a decreased incidence of ruptured aneurysm in men but not women. All-cause mortality was not significantly different between screened and unscreened groups some three to five years after screening, which is to be expected given the relative infrequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a cause of death. Men who had been screened underwent more surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR 2.03; range 1.59 to 2.59, four trials) but resource analysis appears to demonstrate overall cost effectiveness of screening. There were no data on life expectancy, complications of surgery or quality of life."
CD011490,"We included seven studies with 843 participants (421 ELA and 422 SLA). All seven studies included Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival. There was little or no difference in survival between groups (log hazard ratio (log HR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.06 to 3.31; P = 0.94; seven studies, 843 participants; very low-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in postoperative mortality between the groups (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.80; seven studies, 843 participants; low-quality evidence). Operating time was probably longer for ELA (mean difference (MD) 50.13 minutes, 95% CI 19.19 to 81.06 minutes; five studies, 670 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 88%; P < 0.00001). There may have been more blood loss during ELA (MD 137.43 mL, 95% CI 11.55 to 263.30 mL; two studies, 463 participants; very low-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 81%, P = 0.02). There may have been more lymph nodes retrieved during ELA (MD 11.09 nodes, 95% CI 7.16 to 15.02; five studies, 670 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 81%, P < 0.00001). There was little or no difference in the incidence of positive resection margins between groups (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.13; six studies, 783 participants; very low-quality evidence). There is no evidence of an impact on survival with extended versus standard lymph node resection. However, the operating time may have been longer and blood loss greater in the extended resection group. In conclusion, current evidence neither supports nor refutes the effect of extended lymph lymphadenectomy in people with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.","We included seven randomised controlled trials (type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to the treatment groups), published before 10 September 2020, with a total of 843 adult participants who had undergone PD with either standard or extended lymph node removal. There were differences in sample size, treatments, and quality of the research between the studies. We found little or no difference in overall survival between the two groups. It was likely that the operating time was longer, there was more blood loss, and more lymph nodes were removed in the group that underwent extended lymph node resection. However, there was little or no difference in the rate of negative resection margins (i.e. no detectable tumour cells at the cutting surface of the specimen) between the two groups. We conclude that at present, a more extensive removal of lymph nodes does not improve survival in people with pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinomas. Overall, we found low-quality evidence. The studies used different treatment regimens and different definitions of standard and extended lymph node resection; lack of blinding of the surgeons and other caregivers introduced a risk of performance bias for all outcomes; the use of chemotherapy and other co-interventions was different between studies, and between groups in individual studies. Therefore, we have limited confidence in the estimate of the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from what we found."
CD000979,"We included 31 studies that randomised approximately 1410 participants. Eight studies were at low risk of bias, 15 were at high risk of bias, and eight were unclear. Intervention versus observation
For children (age 7 to 11 years), quad-helix was beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 50.59, 95% CI 26.77 to 95.60; 3 studies, 149 participants; high-certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter-molar distances (MD 4.71 mm, 95% CI 4.31 to 5.10; 3 studies, 146 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For children, expansion plates were also beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 25.26, 95% CI 13.08 to 48.77; 3 studies, 148 participants; high-certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter-molar distances (MD 3.30 mm, 95% CI 2.88 to 3.73; 3 studies, 145 participants, 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, expansion plates resulted in higher inter-canine distances (MD 2.59 mm, 95% CI 2.18 to 3.01; 3 studies, 145 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The use of Hyrax is probably effective for correcting posterior crossbite compared to observation (OR 48.02, 95% CI 21.58 to 106.87; 93 participants, 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Two of the studies focused on adolescents (age 12 to 16 years) and found that Hyrax increased the inter-molar distance compared with observation (MD 5.80, 95% CI 5.15 to 6.45; 2 studies, 72 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Intervention A versus intervention B
When comparing quad-helix with expansion plates in children, quad-helix was more effective for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.46; 3 studies, 151 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), final inter-molar distance (MD 1.48 mm, 95% CI 0.91 mm to 2.04 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; high-certainty evidence), inter-canine distance (0.59 mm higher (95% CI 0.09 mm  to 1.08 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence) and length of treatment (MD −3.15 months, 95% CI −4.04 to −2.25; 3 studies, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and Haas for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; 3 studies, 83 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or inter-molar distance (MD −0.15 mm, 95% CI −0.86 mm to 0.56 mm; 2 studies of adolescents, 46 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and tooth-bone-borne expansion for crossbite correction (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 120 participants; low-certainty evidence) or inter-molar distance (MD −0.66 mm, 95% CI −1.36 mm to 0.04 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 65 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax with bone-borne expansion for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 2 studies of adolescents, 81 participants; low-certainty evidence) or inter-molar distance (MD −0.14 mm, 95% CI −0.85 mm to 0.57 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 81 participants; low-certainty evidence). For children in the early mixed dentition stage (age 7 to 11 years old), quad-helix and expansion plates are more beneficial than no treatment for correcting posterior crossbites. Expansion plates also increase the inter-canine distance. Quad-helix is more effective than expansion plates for correcting posterior crossbite and increasing inter-molar distance. Treatment duration is shorter with quad-helix than expansion plates. For adolescents in permanent dentition (age 12 to 16 years old), Hyrax and Haas are similar for posterior crossbite correction and increasing the inter-molar distance. The remaining evidence was insufficient to draw any robust conclusions for the efficacy of posterior crossbite correction.","We found 31 studies with 1410 children and adolescents who were randomly assigned to a treatment or no treatment group. Thirteen studies included children (7 to 11 years old), 12 included adolescents (12 to 16 years old), and six included both. Eight studies were conducted in Turkey, four in Brazil, four in Sweden, three in the USA, three in  Italy, two in Canada, and one each in Germany, UK, Switzerland, Iran, Spain, India, and Australia. Twenty-seven studies were carried out in universities and clinical centres, one study in private practice, and three did not state the location. For children, expansion of the upper arch with fixed or removable braces can correct posterior crossbites. When testing fixed and removable braces against each other, the studies found that quad-helix (fixed appliance) was more successful than expansion plate (removable appliance) and that treatment with quad-helix took less time. For other comparisons between different types of treatments, there was no evidence to show that one worked better than another, but we had moderate to low certainty in the results, so future research may change them. Our confidence in the results is high to moderate for the main results. For the other comparisons, our confidence in the results is low. This review is an update. The evidence is current to April 2021."
CD004466,"This update included 592 participants from seven studies (two new and one that had been excluded in the previous review in 2007. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in the incidence of any pulmonary complications and functional capacity between treatment with IS and treatment with physical therapy, positive pressure breathing techniques (including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB), active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) or preoperative patient education. Patients treated with IS had worse pulmonary function and arterial oxygenation compared with positive pressure breathing. Based on these studies there was no improvement in the muscle strength between groups who received IS demonstrated by maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure. Our update review suggests there is no evidence of benefit from IS in reducing pulmonary complications and in decreasing the negative effects on pulmonary function in patients undergoing CABG. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from IS following CABG.","This update included 592 participants from seven studies (two new and one that had been excluded in the previous 2007 review). We found evidence from four small trials that incentive spirometry offers no advantage over standard post-surgical physical therapy, or preoperative education in preventing breathing complications and pneumonia, improving lung function, or shortening length of hospital stay in patients undergoing CABG. Bigger and better designed trials are needed to determine if there is any role for incentive spirometry."
CD005960,"Nineteen trials providing outcome data for 1597 young to middle-aged adults were included. Many trials were at high risk of bias reflecting inadequate methods of randomization, lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of outcome. Pooled data for primary outcomes, reported in a minority of trials, showed no statistically significant differences between the two graft choices for functional assessment (single leg hop test), return to activity, Tegner and Lysholm scores, and subjective measures of outcome. There were also no differences found between the two interventions for re-rupture or International Knee Documentation Committee scores. There were inadequate long-term results, such as to assess the development of osteoarthritis. All tests (instrumental, Lachman, pivot shift) for static stability consistently showed that PT reconstruction resulted in a more statically stable knee compared with HT reconstruction. Conversely, patients experienced more anterior knee problems, especially with kneeling, after PT reconstruction. PT reconstructions resulted in a statistically significant loss of extension range of motion and a trend towards loss of knee extension strength. HT reconstructions demonstrated a trend towards loss of flexion range of motion and a statistically significant loss of knee flexion strength. The clinical importance of the above range of motion losses is unclear. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on differences between the two grafts for long-term functional outcome. While PT reconstructions are more likely to result in statically stable knees, they are also associated with more anterior knee problems.","This review included 19 studies reporting the outcomes of ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon versus hamstring tendon grafts in a total of 1597 young to middle-aged adults. Many trials used flawed methods that might have affected their results. The limited data available for functional outcomes including patient-rated assessment did not show whether one graft was better than the other. Similarly, there were no differences found between the two types of graft for re-rupture or in the results of an internationally used knee score. All tests for knee stability favoured patellar tendon grafts. Conversely, people had more anterior knee pain and discomfort with kneeling after patellar tendon reconstruction. After patellar tendon reconstruction, more people had some loss in their ability to straighten out their leg at the knee. In contrast, more people had some loss in their ability to bend their leg at the knee after hamstring tendon reconstruction. It is not clear how important these losses in range of motion of the knee were to the patients themselves. The review concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to recommend which of the two types of graft was better for ACL reconstruction."
CD011845,"We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth-delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II - III. Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth-delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low-quality evidence). One study assessing self-efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self-efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI −0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self-care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth-delivered education on HRQoL (MD −0.10, 95% CI −2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low-quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF-related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth-delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. We found that the use of mHealth-delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self-efficacy, self-care and health-related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","We include in this review five randomised controlled trials (971 participants) of mHealth-delivered education interventions for people with HF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years and 63% of participants were men. Studies came from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden and The Netherlands. Five studies addressed HF knowledge; we found that the use of mHealth-delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care. One study assessing self-efficacy reported uncertainty in the evidence for mHealth-delivered education compared with usual care. Three studies evaluated HF self-care using different scales. We did not combine the studies, because of the differences between the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. The studies did not report any side effects of the interventions. Four studies examined health-related quality of life and showed uncertainty in the evidence between mHealth-delivered education and usual care. Three studies reported on HF-related hospitalisation rates. The use of mHealth-delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisations. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low to low, due to limitations in study design and execution and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. There is no evidence for a difference in the use of mHealth-delivered educational intervention for people with HF on HF knowledge. There is uncertainty in the evidence for self-efficacy, self-care and health-related quality of life. There may be little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisations, compared to usual care. 'Usual care' in this case means enrolment in a heart failure-management programme (clinic- or home-based). This is an area of HF research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term."
CD009166,"We included five trials, which in total randomised 1577 women, encompassing both singleton and multiple gestations. After excluding singletons, the final analysis included 128 women, of which 122 women had twin gestations, and six women had triplet gestations. Two trials (n = 73 women) assessed history-indicated cerclage, while three trials (n = 55 women) assessed ultrasound-indicated cerclage. The five trials were judged to be of average to above average quality, with three of the trials at unclear risk regarding selection and detection biases. Concerning the primary outcomes, when outcomes for cerclage were pooled together for all indications and compared with no cerclage, there was no statistically significant differences in perinatal deaths (19.2% versus 9.5%; risk ratio (RR) 1.74, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.92 to 3.28, five trials, n = 262), serious neonatal morbidity (15.8% versus 13.6%; average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.10, three trials, n = 116), or composite perinatal death and neonatal morbidity (40.4% versus 20.3%; average RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.11, three trials, n = 116). Among the secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between the cerclage and the no cerclage groups. To name a few, there were no significant differences among the following: preterm birth less than 34 weeks (average RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.06, four trials, n = 83), preterm birth less than 35 weeks (average RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14, four trials, n = 83), low birthweight less than 2500 g (average RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48, four trials, n = 172), very low birthweight less than 1500 g (average RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.85, four trials, n = 172), and respiratory distress syndrome (average RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.15 to 18.77, three trials, n = 116). There were also no significant differences between the cerclage and no cerclage groups when examining caesarean section (elective and emergency) (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.35, three trials, n = 77) and maternal side-effects (RR 3.92, 95% CI 0.17 to 88.67, one trial, n = 28). Examining the differences between prespecified subgroups, ultrasound-indicated cerclage was associated with an increased risk of low birthweight (average RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.83, Tau² = 0.01, I² = 15%, three trials, n = 98), very low birthweight (average RR 3.31, 95% CI 1.58 to 6.91, Tau² = 0, I² = 0%, three trials, n = 98), and respiratory distress syndrome (average RR 5.07, 95% CI 1.75 to 14.70, Tau² = 0, I² = 0%, three trials, n = 98). However, given the low number of trials, as well as substantial heterogeneity and subgroup differences, these data must be interpreted cautiously. No trials reported on long-term infant neurodevelopmental outcomes. There were no physical exam-indicated cerclages available for comparison among the studies included. This review is based on limited data from five small studies of average to above average quality. For multiple gestations, there is no evidence that cerclage is an effective intervention for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity.","We included five trials, which involved a total of 1577 women, comparing cerclage with no cerclage in women with either singleton and multiple gestations. After excluding singletons, our final analysis included 128 women, of which 122 were pregnant with twins, and six were pregnant with triplets. Cerclage was indicated by obstetric history in two trials (n = 73 women) and transvaginal ultrasound in three trials (n = 55 women). When cerclage was compared with no cerclage in women with multiple gestations, there was no difference in perinatal deaths or neonatal ill health, or preterm birth rates. However, the number of women included in the five studies was insufficient to provide meaningful conclusions. The long-term effect of cerclage on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the surviving infants and maternal infection and side- effects could not be estimated. It was therefore unclear if cerclage for women with multiple pregnancies puts the health of either the mothers or the infants at risk in any way. The five included studies were generally considered to be of average to above average quality, but three of the studies were difficult to assess fully because of missing methodological information. We did not find any studies comparing different indications for cerclage (obstetric history-indicated versus ultrasound-indicated cerclage) or comparing cerclage to another intervention (such as progesterone)."
CD007874,"We included 85 studies, 82 of which (10,350 participants) were eligible for quantitative analysis in the review. All participants, aged 13 years to 89 years, were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III patients undergoing elective surgery. Each study was conducted in a single centre in high- , middle- and low-income countries worldwide. According to the risk of bias assessment, all except five studies were identified as being of satisfactory methodological quality, allowing 82 studies to be combined in the meta-analysis. Five of the 82 studies were assessed as high risk of bias: one for participant and personnel blinding, one for incomplete outcome data, and three for other potential sources of bias. The overall incidence of pain and high-intensity pain following propofol injection in the control group were 63.7% (95% CI 60% to 67.9%) and 37.9% (95% CI 33.4% to 43.1%), respectively while those in the lidocaine group were 30.2% (95% CI 26.7% to 33.7%) and 11.8% (95% CI 9.7% to 13.8%). Both lidocaine admixture and pretreatment were effective in reducing pain on propofol injection (lidocaine admixture OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.25, 31 studies, 4927 participants, high-quality evidence; lidocaine pretreatment OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.18, 41 RCTs, 3918 participants, high-quality evidence). Similarly, lidocaine administration could considerably decrease the incidence of pain when premixed with the propofol (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.24, 36 studies, 5628 participants, high-quality evidence) or pretreated prior to propofol injection (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.18, 50 studies, 4722 participants, high-quality evidence). Adverse effects of lidocaine administration were rare. Thrombophlebitis was reported in only two studies (OR not estimated, low-quality evidence). No studies reported patient satisfaction. Overall, the quality of the evidence was high. Currently available data from RCTs are sufficient to confirm that both lidocaine admixture and pretreatment were effective in reducing pain on propofol injection. Furthermore, there were no significant differences of effect between the two techniques.","We searched the databases until October 2014. We included 85 studies, 82 of which (10,350 participants) were eligible for quantitative analysis. The study participants were randomly selected to receive either intravenous lidocaine injection or normal saline (placebo) at the same time as the propofol injection. We reran the search in November 2015. We found 11 potential studies of interest, those studies were added to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will be fully incorporated into the formal review findings when we update the review. Three out of the 85 studies were funded by either a pharmaceutical manufacturer with a commercial interest in the results of the studies or the company which supplied the propofol. Eight studies were supported by government hospital or university funds and one study was funded by a charitable grant. We found that the injection of lidocaine into a vein, either mixing lidocaine with propofol or injecting lidocaine before propofol, could effectively reduce the incidence and the high levels of pain associated with the injection of propofol. Adverse effects such as inflammation (redness, swelling) of the vein at the injection site were rare and in two studies were not more frequent with the use of lidocaine. No study reported on patient satisfaction. Based on these results we would expect that out of 1000 patients receiving intravenous propofol, about 384 who did not also receive intravenous lidocaine, would experience moderate to severe pain, compared to only 89 patients who also received intravenous lidocaine. The overall quality of evidence was high with a very large beneficial effect obtained by the administration of lidocaine to reduce painful propofol injections."
CD011048,"We found only one quasi-randomised trial with 30 participants that met our inclusion criteria. In the small trial, total and ionised serum calcium levels were measured immediately before and immediately after EBT. All the participants were included in the final analysis and all the important outcomes were reported. Primary outcomes
There was one death in each group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.55; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.18; participants = 30; studies = 1). The study did not report the presence of cardiac arrhythmias within one week of EBT and the number of infants with serum calcium levels (total less than 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L) or ionised less than 4.4 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L)). Pair-wise comparison of EBT with intravenous 10% calcium gluconate versus EBT without intravenous calcium (change from baseline) showed mean total serum calcium was raised in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.11; participants = 30; studies = 1). Very low-quality evidence also indicated an increase in the levels of mean ionised serum calcium in the intervention group compared to the control group (MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.11; participants = 30; studies = 1). Secondary outcomes
Adverse reactions to intravenous calcium therapy included cardiac arrest in one neonate in the intervention arm (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 68.26; RD 0.07, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.23; participants = 30; studies = 1). There was apnoea and hypoglycaemia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.55; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.18; participants = 30; studies = 1) in the two neonates who died. Data were not available for other major secondary outcomes such as the number of infants with reduced serum magnesium, reduced parathormone, increased calcitonin, presence of seizures, carpopedal spasm, jitteriness and prolonged QTc interval on electrocardiography within one week of EBT. Very low-quality data from one quasi-randomised controlled trial suggested that the mean serum total and ionised calcium increased in the study group but decreased in the control group immediately after EBT. However, the mean values of total and ionised calcium in both arms of studies remained within international reference ranges. Unfortunately, data were not available to assess the trend of total and ionised serum calcium to the end of the first week after EBT. Therefore, due to the very low quality of evidence available, it is difficult to support or reject the continual use of prophylactic intravenous calcium in newborn infants receiving EBT. Researchers are encouraged to conduct more robustly designed trials with larger numbers of participants, and particularly, addressing the pattern of differences based on gestational age of participants, type of anticoagulant used, and the volume of blood used.","we identified only one poorly designed study for inclusion. we found that giving calcium to newborn infants raised blood calcium levels immediately after EBT while blood calcium was reduced among newborn infants who did not receive calcium during EBT. However, despite the observed trends in the values of blood calcium in both groups of the study, the average values of blood calcium in both groups remained within normal limits. In addition, the information available for this review was limited as the effects of giving or not giving calcium during EBT was not studied beyond the time of EBT. based on the findings in this review, there is no good-quality evidence to support or reject continual use of calcium during EBT. We are unable to make conclusions, as the evidence that we found is limited and of very low quality and could change if more results from larger and better-designed studies become available."
CD004234,"The original review included 10 studies with 996 participants. This updated review included 15 studies (1509 participants); 11 assessed naproxen sodium and four naproxen. In nine studies (784 participants) using 500/550 mg naproxen or naproxen sodium the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 2.7 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.2). No dose response was demonstrated over the range 200/220 mg to 500/550 mg, but limited data was identified. Median time to use of rescue medication was 8.9 hours for naproxen 500/550 mg and 2.0 hours for placebo. Use of rescue medication was significantly less common with naproxen than placebo. Associated adverse events were generally of mild to moderate severity and rarely led to withdrawal. Doses equivalent to 500 mg and 400 mg naproxen administered orally provided effective analgesia to adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. About half of participants treated with these doses experienced clinically useful levels of pain relief, compared to 15% with placebo, and half required additional medication within nine hours, compared to two hours with placebo. Associated adverse events did not differ from placebo.","This review assessed evidence from 1509 participants in 15 randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of naproxen or naproxen sodium (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. At doses equivalent to 500 mg and 400 mg, orally administered naproxen provides effective analgesia. About half of those treated experienced at least half pain relief over four to six hours, and the effects lasted, on average, up to nine hours. Associated adverse events did not differ from placebo, but these studies are of limited use for studying adverse effects."
CD013795,"We included 67 studies and sampled 43 studies for our analysis. Most were from low- or middle-income countries (33 studies), and most included the perspectives of women and health workers. We downgraded our confidence in several findings from high confidence to moderate, low, or very-low confidence, mainly due to concerns about how the studies were conducted (methodological limitations) or concerns about missing important perspectives from some types of participants or in some settings (relevance). In many communities, bleeding during and after childbirth is considered ""normal"" and necessary to expel ""impurities"" and restore and cleanse the woman's body after pregnancy and birth (moderate confidence). In some communities, people have misconceptions about causes of PPH or believe that PPH is caused by supernatural powers or evil spirits that punish women for ignoring or disobeying social rules or for past mistakes (high confidence). For women who give birth at home or in the community, female family members or traditional birth attendants are the first to recognise excess bleeding after birth (high confidence). Family members typically take the decision of whether and when to seek care if PPH is suspected, and these family members are often influenced by trusted traditional birth attendants or community midwives (high confidence). If PPH is identified for women birthing at home or in the community, decision-making about the subsequent referral and care pathway can be multifaceted and complex (high confidence). First responders to PPH are not always skilled or trained healthcare providers (high confidence). In health facilities, midwives may consider it easy to implement visual estimation of blood loss with a kidney dish or under-pad, but difficult to accurately interpret the amount of blood loss (very low confidence). Quantifying (rather than estimating) blood loss may be a complex and contentious change of practice for health workers (low confidence). Women who gave birth in health facilities and experienced PPH described it as painful, embarrassing, and traumatic. Partners or other family members also found the experience stressful. While some women were dissatisfied with their level of involvement in decision-making for PPH management, others felt health workers were best placed to make decisions (moderate confidence). Inconsistent availability of resources (drugs, medical supplies, blood) causes delays in the timely management of PPH (high confidence). There is limited availability of misoprostol in the community owing to stockouts, poor supply systems, and the difficulty of navigating misoprostol procurement for community health workers (moderate confidence). Health workers described working on the maternity ward as stressful and intense due to short staffing, long shifts, and the unpredictability of emergencies. Exhausted and overwhelmed staff may be unable to appropriately monitor all women, particularly when multiple women are giving birth simultaneously or on the floor of the health facility; this could lead to delays in detecting PPH (moderate confidence). Inadequate staffing, high turnover of skilled health workers, and appointment of lower-level cadres of health workers are key challenges to the provision of quality PPH care (high confidence). Through team-based simulation training, health workers of different cadres (doctors, midwives, lay health workers) can develop a shared mental model to help them work quickly, efficiently, and amicably as a team when managing women with PPH (moderate confidence). Our findings highlight how improving PPH prevention, detection, and management is underpinned by a complex system of interacting roles and behaviours (community, women, health workers of different types and with different experiences). Multiple individual, sociocultural, and environmental factors influence the decisions and behaviours of women, families, communities, health workers, and managers. It is crucial to consider the broader health and social systems when designing and implementing PPH interventions to change or influence these behaviours. We have developed a set of prompts that may help programme managers, policymakers, researchers, and other key stakeholders to identify and address factors that affect implementation and scale-up of interventions to improve PPH prevention, detection, and management.","We sampled 43 studies from 26 countries for our analysis.

If PPH is identified for women birthing at home or in the community, decision-making about the subsequent referral and care pathway can be multi-faceted and complex (high confidence). First responders to PPH are not always skilled or trained healthcare providers (high confidence). In health facilities, midwives may consider it easy to implement visual estimation of blood loss with a kidney dish or underpad, but difficult to accurately interpret the amount of blood loss (very low confidence). Quantifying (rather than estimating) blood loss may be a complex and contentious change of practice for health workers (low confidence). Women who gave birth in health facilities and experienced PPH described it as painful, embarrassing, and traumatic. Partners or other family members also found the experience stressful. While some women were dissatisfied with their level of involvement in decision-making for PPH management, others felt health workers were best placed to make these decisions (moderate confidence). Inconsistent availability of resources (drugs, medical supplies, blood) cause delays in the timely management of PPH (high confidence). Health workers described working on the maternity ward as stressful and intense due to short staffing, long shifts, and the unpredictability of emergencies. Exhausted and overwhelmed staff may be unable to appropriately monitor all women, particularly when multiple women are giving birth simultaneously or on the floor of the health facility; this could lead to delays in detecting PPH (moderate confidence). Inadequate staffing, high turnover of skilled health workers, and appointment of lower-level cadres of health workers make it challenging to provide quality PPH care (high confidence). Through team-based simulation training, health workers of different cadres (doctors, midwives, lay health workers) can develop a shared mental model to help them work quickly, efficiently, and amicably as a team when managing women with PPH (moderate confidence). We searched for studies published before 13 November 2022."
CD004772,"A search of the databases identified a total of 735 unique, previously unreviewed studies, of which 731 were excluded to leave 4 new studies to incorporate into the review. Four additional studies were identified in conference proceedings, for a total of 8 studies addressing when to start treatment (n=2), what to start (n=3), whether to substitute lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with nevirapine (NVP) (n=1), whether to use an induction-maintenance ART strategy (n=1) and whether to interrupt treatment (n=1). Treatment initiation in asymptomatic infants with good immunological status was associated with a 75% reduction (HR=0.25; 95%CI 0.12-0.51; p=0.0002) in mortality or disease progression in the one trial with sufficient power to address this question. In a smaller pilot trial, median CD4 cell count was not significantly different between early and deferred treatment groups 12 months after ART. Regardless of previous exposure to nevirapine for PMTCT, the hazard for treatment failure at 24 weeks was 1.79 (95%CI 1.33, 2.41) times higher in children starting ART with a NVP-based regimen compared to those starting with a LPV/r-based regimen (p=0.0001) with no clear difference in the effect observed for children younger or older than 1 year. The hazard for virological failure at 24 weeks was overall 1.84 (95%CI 1.29, 2.63) times higher for children starting ART with a NVP-based regimen compared to those starting with a LPV/r-based regimen (p=0.0008) with a larger difference in time to virological failure (or death) between the NVP and LPV/r-based regimens when ART was initiated in the first year of life. Infants starting a LPV/r regimen and achieving sustained virological suppression who then substituted LPV/r with NVP after median 9 months on LPV/r were less likely to develop virological failure (defined as at least one VL greater than 50 copies/mL) compared with infants who started and stayed on LPV/r (HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.41, 0.92, p=0.02). However the hazard for confirmed failure at a higher viral load (>1000 copies/mL) was greater among children who switched to NVP compared to those who remained on LPV/r (HR=10.19, 95% CI 2.36, 43.94, p=0.002). Children undergoing an induction-maintenance ART approach with a 4-drug NNRTI-based regimen for 36 weeks, followed by 3-drug ART, had significantly greater CD4 rise than children receiving a standard 3-drug NNRTI-based ART at 36 weeks (mean difference 1.70 [95%CI 0.61, 2.79] p=0.002) and significantly better viral load response at 24 weeks (OR 1.99 [95%CI 1.09, 3.62] p=0.02). However, the immunological and virological benefits were short-term. The one trial of treatment interruption that compared children initiating continuous ART from infancy with children interrupting ART was terminated early because the duration of treatment interruption was less than 3 months in most infants. Children interrupting treatment had similar growth and occurrence of serious adverse events as those in the continuous arm. ART initiation in asymptomatic children under 1 year of age reduces morbidity and mortality, but it remains unclear whether there are clinical benefits to starting ART in asymptomatic children diagnosed with HIV infection between 1-3 years. The available evidence shows that a LPV/r-based first-line regimen is more efficacious than a NVP-based regimen, regardless of PMTCT exposure status. New formulations of LPV/r are urgently required to enable new WHO recommendations to be implemented. An alternative approach to long-term LPV/r is substituting LPV/r with NVP once virological suppression is achieved. This strategy looked promising in the one trial undertaken, but may be difficult to implement in the absence of routine viral load testing. A 4-drug induction-maintenance approach showed short-term virological and immunological benefits during the induction phase but, in the absence of sustained benefits, is not recommended as a routine treatment strategy. Treatment interruption following early ART initiation in infancy was challenging for children who were severely immunocompromised in the context of poor clinical immunological condition at ART initiation due to the short duration of interruption, and is therefore not practical in ART treatment programmes where close monitoring is not feasible.","Results from this systematic review show that ART soon after birth is preferable to delaying treatment, because infants are less likely to die or become sick. Starting a first-line treatment regimen that includes lopinavir/ritonavir rather than nevirapine is preferable, because infants and young children are less likely to have to stop treatment, whether or not they had previously been exposed to nevirapine. However, lopinavir/ritonavir is more expensive than nevirapine. It is also currently only available as an inconvenient liquid, which tastes bitter and has to be refrigerated, making it challenging to implement in all parts of the world. While waiting for better formulations to become available, it may be possible to switch from lopinavir/ritonavir to nevirapine once the HIV virus levels become undetectable. However, based on the evidence currently available, a viral load test would be required to identify those children who could safely substitute lopinavir/ritonavir with nevirapine. Viral loads are expensive and not widely available in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. An alternative treatment approach is to give a stronger drug combination (four different drugs together) when treatment is first started, then reduce down to three drugs after a short while. However, this strategy did not appear to have long-term benefits. A 'treatment interruption' strategy, in which infants start ART soon after birth but then stop medication after 1-2 years, is difficult to implement. Children stopping ART need to restart it very quickly to prevent them becoming sick, and monitoring a child off treatment is challenging in settings with few resources."
CD009806,"One study was included involving 39 participants who received either ERT with galsulfase (recombinant human arylsulphatase B) or placebo. This small study was considered overall to have an unclear risk of bias in relation to the design and implementation of the study, since the authors did not report how both the allocation generation and concealment were performed. Given the very low certainty of the evidence, we are uncertain whether at 24 weeks there was a difference between groups in relation to the 12-minute walk test, mean difference (MD) of 92.00 meters (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.00 to 172.00), or the three-minute stair climb, MD 5.70 (95% CI -0.10 to 11.50). In relation to respiratory tests, we are uncertain whether galsulfase makes any difference as compared to placebo in forced vital capacity in litres (FVC (L) (absolute change in baseline), given the very low certainty of the evidence. Cardiac function was not reported in the included study. We found that galsulfase, as compared to placebo, may decrease urinary glycosaminoglycan levels at 24 weeks, MD -227.00 (95% CI -264.00 to -190.00) (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether there are differences between the galsulfase and placebo groups in relation to adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). In general, the dose of galsulfase was well tolerated and there were no differences between groups. These events include drug-related adverse events, serious and severe adverse events, those during infusion, drug-related adverse events during infusion, and deaths. More infusion-related reactions were observed in the galsulfase group and were managed with interruption or slowing of infusion rate or administration of antihistamines or corticosteroids drugs. No deaths occurred during the study. The results of this review are based only on one small study (a 24-week randomised phase of the study and prior to the open-label extension). We are uncertain whether galsulfase is more effective than placebo, for treating people with MPS VI, in relation to the 12-minute walk test or the three-minute stair climb, as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. We found that galsulfase may reduce urinary glycosaminoglycans levels. We are also uncertain whether there are any differences between treatment groups in relation to cardiac or pulmonary functions, liver or spleen volume, overnight apnea-hypopnea, height and weight, quality of life and adverse effects. Further studies are needed to obtain more information on the long-term effectiveness and safety of ERT with galsulfase.","The review includes one study with 39 people with MPS VI aged between five and 20 years old. The study compared galsulfase to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The study lasted for 24 weeks (with an extension period of an additional 24 weeks where everyone was given ERT and they knew it). The evidence for this treatment is limited because we only found and assessed the results of one small study. Given the very low certainty of the evidence, we are unsure whether galsulfase improves motor function (i.e. the ability to walk and climb stairs) in people with MPS VI. We found that treatment with galsulfase may lower levels of the chemicals associated with MPS VI (glycosaminoglycan levels) in urine tests. These results were seen in a short study and may reflect only short-term effects. There were no differences between treatment with galsulfase and placebo in relation to adverse effects. More research is needed to study the long-term effects on heart and lung function, quality of life and survival. The methods and the study design were not clearly described and the impact of this on possible bias is unclear. The certainty of the evidence has been graded as low to very low."
CD014876,"We included four RCTs enrolling 331 infants in four countries across different continents. Most studies considered patients undergoing large or medium surgical procedures (including major thoracic or abdominal surgery), who potentially required pain control through opioid administration after surgery. The randomized trials did not consider patients undergoing minor surgery (including inguinal hernia repair) and those individuals exposed to opioids before the beginning of the trial. Two RCTs compared opioids with placebo; one fentanyl with tramadol; and one morphine with paracetamol. No meta-analyses could be performed because the included RCTs reported no more than three outcomes within the prespecified comparisons. Certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes due to imprecision of the estimates (downgrade by two levels) and study limitations (downgrade by one level). Comparison 1: opioids versus no treatment or placebo
Two trials were included in this comparison, comparing either tramadol or tapentadol with placebo. No data were reported on the following critical outcomes: pain; major neurodevelopmental disability; or cognitive and educational outcomes in children more than five years old. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tramadol compared with placebo on all-cause mortality during initial hospitalization (RR 0.32, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.01 to 7.70; RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.05, 71 participants, 1 study; I² = not applicable). No data were reported on: retinopathy of prematurity; or intraventricular hemorrhage. Comparison 2: opioids versus non-pharmacological interventions
No trials were included in this comparison. Comparison 3: head-to-head comparisons of different opioids
One trial comparing fentanyl with tramadol was included in this comparison. No data were reported on the following critical outcomes: pain; major neurodevelopmental disability; or cognitive and educational outcomes in children more than five years old. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of fentanyl compared with tramadol on all-cause mortality during initial hospitalization (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.64; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.13, 171 participants, 1 study; I² = not applicable). No data were reported on: retinopathy of prematurity; or intraventricular hemorrhage. Comparison 4: opioids versus other analgesics and sedatives
One trial comparing morphine with paracetamol was included in this comparison. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of morphine compared with paracetamol on COMFORT pain scores (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.85 to 1.05; 71 participants, 1 study; I² = not applicable). No data were reported on the other critical outcomes, i.e. major neurodevelopmental disability; cognitive and educational outcomes in children more than five years old, all-cause mortality during initial hospitalization; retinopathy of prematurity; or intraventricular hemorrhage. Limited evidence is available on opioid administration for postoperative pain in newborn infants compared to either placebo, other opioids, or paracetamol. We are uncertain whether tramadol reduces mortality compared to placebo; none of the studies reported pain scores, major neurodevelopmental disability, cognitive and educational outcomes in children older than five years old, retinopathy of prematurity, or intraventricular hemorrhage. We are uncertain whether fentanyl reduces mortality compared to tramadol; none of the studies reported pain scores, major neurodevelopmental disability, cognitive and educational outcomes in children older than five years old, retinopathy of prematurity, or intraventricular hemorrhage. We are uncertain whether morphine reduces pain compared to paracetamol; none of the studies reported major neurodevelopmental disability, cognitive and educational outcomes in children more than five years old, all-cause mortality during initial hospitalization, retinopathy of prematurity, or intraventricular hemorrhage. We identified no studies comparing opioids versus non-pharmacological interventions.","We wanted to find out the impact of giving opioids to babies having surgery, compared to:
1) no treatment or placebo (a 'dummy' treatment, or sham treatment, that does not contain any medicine but looks or tastes identical to the medicine being tested);
2) non-medicine-based treatments (such as sweet solutions);
3) other medicines; or
4) different types of opioids. We searched for studies that compared opioids with the four treatments described above. We compared and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included four studies that involved 331 babies. The biggest study was in 171 babies and the smallest study was in 15 babies. • Two studies compared opioids with placebo: it is unclear if opioids have an effect on mortality; no studies reported pain, long-term development, vision problems (retinopathy of prematurity) or bleeding to the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage). • One study compared one type of opioid to another type of opioid: it is unclear if fentanyl has an effect on mortality compared to tramadol; no studies reported pain, long-term development, vision problems or bleeding to the brain. • One study compared an opioid to a different type of pain-relieving medicine: it is unclear if the opioid morphine has an effect on pain compared with paracetamol; no studies reported long-term development, mortality, vision problems or bleeding to the brain. We are not confident in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. Also, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were given. Not all the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. We searched for studies that were available up to May 2021."
CD011460,"We included four studies with 1029 participants. All the studies used a parallel-group design, and included an initial titration phase to determine the maximum effective and tolerated dose, followed by a maintenance phase. Tapentadol medication was taken twice daily and doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg per day. Rescue medication (morphine or oxycodone immediate-release) was available to participants in all studies. Overall, 440 participants were randomised in classically designed RCTs, and 589 participants were enrolled in enriched-enrolment, randomised-withdrawal (EERW) trials. A total of 476 participants were randomised to titration with tapentadol and 338 participants took tapentadol throughout the maintenance phase of their trial. All studies used numerical rating scores, Patient Global Impression of Change scores, and use of rescue medication as measures of efficacy, and all reported on adverse events and withdrawals. All studies enrolled fewer than 200 participants per treatment arm and were therefore at risk of overestimating efficacy. One study was terminated early due to problems with supply of rescue medication, with fewer than 20 participants enrolled per treatment arm in the maintenance phase of the trial. We judged another study at high risk of bias due to an open-label design. There were insufficient data for pooling and statistical analysis. Response rates for pain intensity were comparable across treatment groups in each study. In one EERW study, response rates were high across both treatment and placebo arms during the maintenance phase (62% tapentadol, 69% morphine, 50% placebo). For pain relief, tapentadol is no more and no less effective than oxycodone or morphine (low quality evidence). Treatment emergent adverse event rates were high, approximately 50% to 90%. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, constipation) (low quality evidence). There was no advantage of tapentadol over morphine or oxycodone in terms of serious adverse events. The number of people experiencing effects on consciousness, appetite, or thirst was low. Information from RCTs on the effectiveness and tolerability of tapentadol was limited. The available studies were of moderate or small size and used different designs, which prevented pooling of data. Pain relief and adverse events were comparable between the tapentadol and morphine and oxycodone groups.","We found four studies with 1029 participants. All four studies compared participants taking tapentadol to participants taking similar medicine, such as morphine or oxycodone. All studies gave participants a period of time to find the best dose to take, before continuing on the medication and comparing their pain levels. All the studies were small or medium sized, so the results are at risk of being influenced by random fluctuations rather than real differences, and they may also overestimate any effects. One trial allowed participants to know what medication they were taking, and one trial was stopped early due administrative problems, so they did not have enough people in the study. We have to be cautious interpreting results from these studies. Because the studies all used different designs, we could not compare the results from one with another. However, each study showed that there was not much difference between the pain levels of people taking tapentadol and people taking morphine and oxycodone. Pain levels were generally well controlled. The studies also showed there was no measurable difference in how many adverse effects people had while taking tapentadol, morphine, or oxycodone. Therefore, we can conclude only that the studies to date show tapentadol was no more or less effective and no more or less well tolerated than morphine and oxycodone."
CD012680,"We included four studies (188 participants). Two studies were double-blind RCTs, one was a non-randomised controlled trial, and one was an observational retrospective case-matched study. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had quiescent IBD and in one study participants had active or quiescent IBD. Participants in one study had co-morbid anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants in clinical ranges. Three studies had placebo controls and one study had a no treatment control group. One RCT was rated as low risk of bias and the other was rated as high risk of bias (incomplete outcome data). The non-randomised controlled trial was rated as high risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding). The observational study was rated as high methodological quality, but is still considered to be at high risk of bias given its observational design. The effect of antidepressants on anxiety and depression is uncertain. At 12 weeks, the mean anxiety score in antidepressant participants was 6.11 + 3 compared to 8.5 + 3.45 in placebo participants (MD -2.39, 95% -4.30 to -0.48, 44 participants, low certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean anxiety score in antidepressant participants was 3.8 + 2.5 compared to 4.2 + 4.9 in placebo participants (MD -0.40, 95% -3.47 to 2.67, 26 participants; low certainty evidence). At 12 weeks, the mean depression score in antidepressant participants was 7.47 + 2.42 compared to 10.5 + 3.57 in placebo participants (MD -3.03, 95% CI -4.83 to -1.23, 44 participants; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, the mean depression score in antidepressant participants was 2.9 + 2.8 compared to 3.1 + 3.4 in placebo participants (MD -0.20, 95% -2.62 to 2.22, 26 participants; low certainty evidence). The effect of antidepressants on AEs is uncertain. Fifty-seven per cent (8/14) of antidepressant participants group reported AEs versus 25% (3/12) of placebo participants (RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.78 to 6.73, low certainty evidence). Commonly reported AEs include nausea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual problems, insomnia, fatigue, low mood/anxiety, dry mouth, muscle spasms and hot flushes. None of the included studies reported any serious AEs. None of the included studies reported on pain. One study (44 participants) reported on QoL at 12 weeks and another study (26 participants) reported on QoL at 12 months. Physical, Psychological, Social and Environmental QoL were improved at 12 weeks compared to placebo (all low certainty evidence). There were no group differences in QoL at 12 months (all low certainty evidence). The effect of antidepressants on maintenance of clinical remission and endoscopic relapse is uncertain. At 12 months, 64% (9/14) of participants in the antidepressant group maintained clinical remission compared to 67% (8/12) of placebo participants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.69; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, none (0/30) of participants in the antidepressant group had endoscopic relapse compared to 10% (3/30) of placebo participants (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.65; very low certainty evidence). The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in IBD can be drawn. Future studies should employ RCT designs, with a longer follow-up and develop solutions to address attrition. Inclusion of objective markers of disease activity is strongly recommended as is testing antidepressants from different classes, as at present it is unclear if any antidepressant (or class thereof) has differential efficacy.","The researchers searched the medical literature up to 23 August 2018. Four published studies, including a total of 188 people, examined antidepressant therapy in people with IBD. The age of participants ranged from 27 to 37.8 years. In three studies participants had IBD in remission and in one study participants had either active IBD or IBD in remission. Participants in one study had co-existing anxiety or depression. One study used duloxetine (60 mg daily), one study used fluoxetine (20 mg daily), one study used tianeptine (36 mg daily), and one study used various antidepressants. Three studies had a placebo (e.g. sugar pill) control group and one study had a no treatment control group. The analysis showed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression were improved in those who took antidepressants compared to placebo. Participants who received antidepressants experienced more side effects than those who received placebo. Side effects reported by those taking antidepressants included: nausea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual problems, insomnia, fatigue, low mood/anxiety, dry mouth, poor sleep, restless legs and hot flushes. Some aspects of quality of life were improved as was IBD activity in the antidepressant group. The overall quality of the studies included in this review was poor because the studies included small numbers of participants, and involved IBD populations which differed from each other on key characteristics. In addition, different types of antidepressants were assessed so the evidence for any one antidepressant was uncertain. Therefore, future studies are needed to confirm these observations. The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of antidepressants in IBD can be drawn. More studies are needed to allow for firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of the use of antidepressants in people with IBD."
CD008934,"Thirty-six randomised controlled trials involving 1597 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared saliva stimulants to placebo, nine trials compared saliva substitutes to placebo, five trials compared saliva stimulants directly with saliva substitutes, 18 trials directly compared two or more saliva substitutes, and two trials directly compared two or more saliva stimulants. Only one trial was at low risk of bias and 17 were at high risk of bias. Due to the range of interventions, comparisons and outcome measures in the trials, meta-analysis was possible for only a few comparisons. Oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) saliva substitute spray shows evidence of effectiveness compared to an electrolyte spray (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.15) which corresponds to approximately a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) for mouth dryness. Both integrated mouthcare systems (toothpaste + gel + mouthwash) and oral reservoir devices show promising results but there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend their use. Although chewing gum is associated with increased saliva production in the majority of those with residual capacity, there is no evidence that gum is more or less effective than saliva substitutes. There is no strong evidence from this review that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth. OGT spray is more effective than an aqueous electrolyte spray (SMD 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15) which is approximately equivalent to a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point VAS scale for mouth dryness. Chewing gums appear to increase saliva production in those with residual secretory capacity and may be preferred by patients, but there is no evidence that gum is better or worse than saliva substitutes. Integrated mouthcare systems and oral reservoir devices may be helpful but further research is required to confirm this. Well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials of topical interventions for dry mouth, which are designed and reported according to CONSORT guidelines, are required to provide evidence to guide clinical care. For many people the symptom of dry mouth is a chronic problem and trials should evaluate whether treatments are palatable, effective in reducing xerostomia, as well as the long-term effects of treatments on quality of life of those with chronic dry mouth symptoms.","Many topical treatments (applied directly to the inside of the mouth) such as sprays, lozenges, mouthrinses, gels, oils, chewing gum or toothpastes have been evaluated in this review, but there is no strong evidence that any topical treatment is effective for relieving the sensation of dry mouth. Oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) saliva substitute spray is more effective than a water based electrolyte spray. A gel-releasing device worn in the mouth, or a mouthcare system might be effective but more research is needed. Chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no evidence that gum is better or worse than saliva substitutes. Acidic products and those containing sugar should be avoided."
CD000443,"We included 17 trials, recruiting 2422 participants, for which outcome data are currently available. Participants tended to be a selected elderly group of stroke survivors with moderate disability. The ESD group showed reductions in the length of hospital stay equivalent to approximately six days (mean difference (MD) -5.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3 to -8 days; P < 0.0001; moderate-grade evidence). The primary outcome was available for 16 trials (2359 participants). Overall, the odds ratios (OR) for the outcome of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow-up (median 6 months; range 3 to 12) was OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.01, moderate-grade evidence) which equates to five fewer adverse outcomes per 100 patients receiving ESD. The results for death (16 trials; 2116 participants) and death or requiring institutional care (12 trials; 1664 participants) were OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.40, P = 0.81, moderate-grade evidence) and OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, P = 0.02, moderate-grade evidence), respectively. Small improvements were also seen in participants' extended activities of daily living scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.25, P = 0.01, low-grade evidence) and satisfaction with services (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.38, P = 0.02, low-grade evidence). We saw no clear differences in participants' activities of daily living scores, patients subjective health status or mood, or the subjective health status, mood or satisfaction with services of carers. We found low-quality evidence that the risk of readmission to hospital was similar in the ESD and conventional care group (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.51, P = 0.59, low-grade evidence). The evidence for the apparent benefits were weaker at one- and five-year follow-up. Estimated costs from six individual trials ranged from 23% lower to 15% greater for the ESD group in comparison to usual care. In a series of pre-planned analyses, the greatest reductions in death or dependency were seen in the trials evaluating a co-ordinated ESD team with a suggestion of poorer results in those services without a co-ordinated team (subgroup interaction at P = 0.06). Stroke patients with mild to moderate disability at baseline showed greater reductions in death or dependency than those with more severe stroke (subgroup interaction at P = 0.04). Appropriately resourced ESD services with co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input provided for a selected group of stroke patients can reduce long-term dependency and admission to institutional care as well as reducing the length of hospital stay. Results are inconclusive for services without co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input. We observed no adverse impact on the mood or subjective health status of patients or carers, nor on readmission to hospital.","We identified 17 clinical trials recruiting 2422 stroke patients (searching completed to January 2017). Patients who were recruited tended to have a moderate degree of disability (able to walk with assistance) and be sufficiently well to consider returning home. We categorised services as those based on a multidisciplinary ESD team (with different levels of co-ordination and delivery) and those with no multidisciplinary team co-ordination (no ESD team). The length of initial stay in hospital was reduced by approximately five days for the ESD group. At an average of six months after their stroke ESD patients were more likely to be living at home (an extra five patients living at home for every 100 receiving ESD services; moderate-quality evidence). They were also more likely to be independent in daily activities (an extra six patients independent for every 100 receiving ESD services; moderate-quality evidence). We identified no apparent hazards in terms of patient mood or quality of life, carer mood or quality of life, or the risk of readmission to hospital. The greatest reductions in disability seemed to be present in trials based around a co-ordinated ESD team. When compared with usual care, costs of ESD services ranged from a reduction to a modest increase. The quality of the evidence was downgraded to 'moderate' for the main outcomes of death, discharge home or disability. This was because it was impossible to hide the treating service from participants or healthcare workers. These conclusions were not dependent on trials judged to be lower quality because of poor design or missing data. More information was missing for some of the other outcome measures, which we have downgraded to low-quality evidence. Appropriately resourced ESD services with co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input can reduce disability and the length of time in hospital at least for a selected group of people with stroke. Results are unclear for services that are not based on a co-ordinated multidisciplinary team input. We did not identify any substantial harmful effects."
CD005182,"72 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included studies varied. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (WMD) -8.0 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.8 to -7.2 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -4.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.7 to -3.9 mmHg) for three strata of entry blood pressure, and all-cause mortality at five years follow-up (6.4% versus 7.8%, difference 1.4%) in a single large RCT- the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reduction in systolic blood pressure (WMD -2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.7 to -1.3 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2 mmHg). RCTs of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way forward, with the majority of RCTs being associated with improved blood pressure control and mean SBP and DBP but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems also require further evaluation due to heterogeneity and small trial numbers, but the majority of trials increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow-up (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73). Family practices and community-based clinics need to have an organized system of regular follow-up and review of their hypertensive patients. Antihypertensive drug therapy should be implemented by means of a vigorous stepped care approach when patients do not reach target blood pressure levels. Self-monitoring and appointment reminders may be useful adjuncts to the above strategies to improve blood pressure control but require further evaluation.","Seventy two randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The range of interventions used included (1) self-monitoring, (2) educational interventions directed to the patient, (3) educational interventions directed to the health professional, (4) health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care, (5) organizational interventions that aimed to improve the delivery of care, (6) appointment reminder systems. The trials showed a wide variety of methodological quality, part of which may be attributed to poor reporting. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce blood pressure and all-cause mortality in a single large RCT- the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Weighted data analysis showed that self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reductions in systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference -2.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.7 to -1.3 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference -1.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.4 to -1.2 mmHg). Trials of educational interventions directed at patients or health professionals were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure by themselves. Nurse or pharmacist led care may be a promising way of improving control in patients with hypertension, with the majority of RCTs being associated with improved blood pressure control, improved systolic blood pressure and more modestly improved diastolic blood pressure, but these interventions require further evaluation. Appointment reminder systems increased the proportion of individuals who attended for follow-up (absolute difference 16%, but this pooled result should be treated with caution because of the heterogeneous results from individual RCTs) and in two small trials also led to improved blood pressure control, odds ratio favouring intervention 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73). We conclude that an organized system of registration, recall and regular review allied to a vigorous stepped care approach to antihypertensive drug treatment appears the most likely way to improve the control of high blood pressure. Health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care and appointment reminder systems requires further evaluation. Education alone, either to health professionals or patients, does not appear to be associated with large net reductions in blood pressure."
CD001916,"Twelve studies were identified in the searches and seven of these were eligible for inclusion in the review. Five studies, involving 260 participants, provided data for analysis. One study showed that cognitive behaviour therapy significantly reduced the affective component of pain (feelings about pain), mean difference -0.99 (95% confidence interval -1.62 to -0.36), but not the sensory component (pain intensity), mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval -9.39 to 9.39). One study of family psycho-education was not associated with a reduction in depression. Another study evaluating cognitive behavioural therapy had inconclusive results for the assessment of coping strategies, and showed no difference between groups assessed on health service utilisation. In addition, family home-based cognitive behavioural therapy did not show any difference compared to disease education. One study of patient education on health beliefs showed a significant improvement in attitudes towards health workers, mean difference -4.39 (95% CI -6.45 to -2.33) and medication, mean difference -1.74 (95% CI -2.98 to -0.50). Nonetheless, these results may not apply across all ages, severity of sickle cell disease, types of pain (acute or chronic), or setting. Evidence for the efficacy of psychological therapies in sickle cell disease is currently limited. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions in sickle cell disease.","We searched for randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which compared psychological treatments to each other or to no treatment in sickle cell disease. We included seven studies in the review, of which five, with 260 people, had data we could enter into the review. One study showed that cognitive behaviour therapy reduced the affective part of pain (feelings about pain), but not the sensory part (pain intensity). Another study of this therapy had inconclusive results for coping strategies and showed no difference on how different groups used the health service. A study using cognitive behavioural therapy with teenagers and their families at home did not show any difference when compared with education about sickle cell disease. One education study did not show a reduction in depression. Furthermore, one study in patient education helped improve attitudes to healthcare workers and medication use in adolescents and young adults. The authors believe that some patient education seems relevant for children, adolescents and young adults, while methods to improve the ability to cope in both children and adults are important. Nonetheless, these results may not apply to across all ages, clinical severity, types of pain (acute or chronic) that people with sickle cell disease have, or which country they live in. More research needs to be done in this area."
CD006058,"We included 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants in this updated review. The methodological quality of the included studies was difficult to assess as it was poorly reported, so the predominant classification of bias was 'unclear'; the studies did not report on compliance with the prescribed therapy. We were able to include data from only 1160 patients in the meta-analysis. Four trials (152 patients) compared the effects of IS with no respiratory treatment. We found no statistically significant difference between the participants receiving IS and those who had no respiratory treatment for clinical complications (relative risk (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.18). Two trials (194 patients) IS compared incentive spirometry with deep breathing exercises (DBE). We found no statistically significant differences between the participants receiving IS and those receiving DBE in the meta-analysis for respiratory failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.04 to 10.50). Two trials (946 patients) compared IS with other chest physiotherapy. We found no statistically significant differences between the participants receiving IS compared to those receiving physiotherapy in the risk of developing a pulmonary condition or the type of complication. There was no evidence that IS is effective in the prevention of pulmonary complications. There is low quality evidence regarding the lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large RCTs with high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from the use of incentive spirometry regarding mortality.","We included adults (aged 18 years and above) admitted for any type of upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to August 2013. We found 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants. The maximum period of time that a patient was followed by the doctor was seven days postoperatively. The quality of the included studies was uncertain because of poor reporting in the published articles. The following results were examined in this review: clinical complications, respiratory failure (that is, inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system), and pulmonary complications. The results from participants receiving IS were the same as for those receiving either no treatment, deep breathing exercises (DBE) or physiotherapy in the meta-analyses for clinical complications, respiratory failure, and pulmonary complications. Because of poorly conducted studies (results not similar across studies; some issues with study design and; not enough data collected and organized) we ranked the overall quality of the evidence reported in this review as low. There is low quality evidence showing a lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field."
CD005457,"We included 11 studies (2635 women) in the review. Six trials compared carbetocin with oxytocin; four of these were conducted for women undergoing caesarean deliveries, one was for women following vaginal deliveries and one did not state the mode of delivery clearly. The carbetocin was administered as 100 µg intravenous dosage across the trials, while oxytocin was administered intravenously but at varied dosages. Four trials compared intramuscular carbetocin and intramuscular syntometrine for women undergoing vaginal deliveries. Three of the trials were on women with no risk factor for PPH, while one trial was on women with risk factors for PPH. One trial compared the use of intravenous carbetocin with placebo. Use of carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics (risk ratio (RR) 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.88; four trials, 1173 women) compared to oxytocin for those who underwent caesarean section, but not for vaginal delivery. Compared to oxytocin, carbetocin was associated with a reduced need for uterine massage following both caesarean delivery (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.79; two trials, 739 women) and vaginal delivery (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94; one trial, 160 women). There were no statistically significant differences between carbetocin and oxytocin in terms of risk of any PPH (blood loss greater than 500 ml) or in risk of severe PPH (blood loss greater than 1000 ml). Comparison between carbetocin and syntometrine showed a lower mean blood loss in women who received carbetocin compared to syntometrine (mean difference (MD) -48.84 ml; 95% CI -94.82 to -2.85; four trials, 1030 women). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the need for therapeutic uterotonic agents, but the risk of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting were significantly lower in the carbetocin group: nausea (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40; four trials, 1030 women); vomiting (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.39; four trials, 1030 women). The incidence of postpartum hypertension was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Cost-effectiveness of carbetocin was investigated by one study published as an abstract, with limited data. For women who undergo caesarean section, carbetocin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics compared to oxytocin, but there is no difference in the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage. Carbetocin is associated with less blood loss compared to syntometrine in the prevention of PPH for women who have vaginal deliveries and is associated with significantly fewer adverse effects. Further research is needed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of carbetocin as a uterotonic agent.","This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company."
CD010105,"We identified two eligible studies, both comparing the use of one model of SAD, the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) with a TT, with a total study population of 232. One study population underwent laparoscopic surgery. The included studies were generally of high quality, but there was an unavoidable high risk of bias in the main airway variables, such as change of device or laryngospasm, as the intubator could not be blinded. Many outcomes included data from one study only. A total of 5/118 (4.2%) participants randomly assigned to PLMA across both studies were changed to TT insertion because of failed or unsatisfactory placement of the device. Postoperative episodes of hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation < 92% whilst breathing air) were less common in the PLMA groups (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.72). We found a significant postoperative difference in mean oxygen saturation, with saturation 2.54% higher in the PLMA group (95% CI 1.09% to 4.00%). This analysis showed high levels of heterogeneity between results (I2 = 71%). The leak fraction was significantly higher in the PLMA group, with the largest difference seen during abdominal insufflation－a 6.4% increase in the PLMA group (95% CI 3.07% to 9.73%). No cases of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, mortality or serious respiratory complications were reported in either study. We are therefore unable to present effect estimates for these outcomes. In all, 2/118 participants with a PLMA suffered laryngospam or bronchospasm compared with 4/114 participants with a TT. The pooled estimate shows a non-significant reduction in laryngospasm in the PLMA group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.59). Postoperative coughing was less common in the PLMA group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31), and there was no significant difference in the risk of sore throat or dysphonia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.13). On average, PLMA placement took 5.9 seconds longer than TT placement (95% CI 3 seconds to 8.8 seconds). There was no significant difference in the proportion of successful first placements of a device, with 33/35 (94.2%) first-time successes in the PLMA group and 32/35 (91.4%) in the TT group. We have inadequate information to draw conclusions about safety, and we can only comment on one design of SAD (the PLMA) in obese patients. We conclude that during routine and laparoscopic surgery, PLMAs may take a few seconds longer to insert, but this is unlikely to be a matter of clinical importance. A failure rate of 3% to 5% can be anticipated in obese patients. However, once fitted, PLMAs provide at least as good oxygenation, with the caveat that the leak fraction may increase, although in the included studies, this did not affect ventilation. We found significant improvement in oxygenation during and after surgery, indicating better pulmonary performance of the PLMA, and reduced postoperative coughing, suggesting better recovery for patients.","We searched the databases to September 2012, to find controlled trials that had randomly assigned obese participants (with body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2) undergoing general anaesthesia to TT or SAD for airway management. We wanted to investigate the effect of airway type on risk of failed placement; serious complications and death; oxygenation of the blood during and after surgery; coughing, sore throat or hoarseness during or after placement; and time taken and number of attempts needed to fit the airway. We found two randomized studies with a total of 232 obese participants, both of which studied one model of SAD－the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA). No relevant outcomes for death or other serious complications occurred in these studies.We found that in 3% to 5% of obese participants, it was not possible to fit a PLMA, and a change of device to a TT was required. The proportion of successful first attempts at airway placement did not differ between PLMA and TT, although it took approximately six seconds longer to place an SAD than a TT. We found significant postoperative reduction of almost 75% in episodes of low oxygen saturation and an improvement in mean oxygen saturation of 2.5% during recovery in the PLMA group. Postoperative cough was less common among participants in the PLMA group. Our findings are consistent with both increased and decreased risks of both sore throat and hoarseness in the PLMA group. Identifying optimal anaesthetic techniques for obese patients is a priority for research. We could not establish the safety of SAD use in obese patients. Large databases created from medical records may be needed to clarify this issue."
CD007193,"There were 8203 citations identified from database searches and reference lists. We included 12 trials with 2605 consumer participants and more than 905 primary care practitioner participants. Eleven trials compared consultation liaison to standard care and one compared consultation liaison to collaborative care, with a case manager co-ordinating mental health care. People with depression were included in eight trials; and one trial each included people with a variety of disorders: depression, anxiety and somatoform disorders; medically unexplained symptoms; and drinking problems. None of the included trials reported separate data for children or older people. There was some evidence that consultation liaison improved mental health up to three months following the start of treatment (two trials, n = 445, NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 25) but there was no evidence of its effectiveness between three and 12 months. Consultation liaison also appeared to improve consumer satisfaction (up to three months: one trial, n = 228, NNTB 3, 95% CI 3 to 5; 3 to 12 months: two trials, n = 445, NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 17) and adherence (3 to 12 months: seven trials, n = 1251, NNTB 6, 95% CI 4 to 13) up to 12 months. There was also an improvement in the primary care provider outcomes of providing adequate treatment between three to 12 months (three trials, n = 797, NNTB 7, 95% CI 4 to 17) and prescribing pharmacological treatment up to 12 months (four trials, n = 796, NNTB 13, 95% CI 7 to 50). There was also some evidence that consultation liaison may not be as effective as collaborative care in regards to symptoms of mental disorder, disability, general health status, and provision of treatment. The quality of these findings were low for all outcomes however, apart from consumer adherence from three to 12 months, which was of moderate quality. Eight trials were rated a high risk of performance bias because consumer participants were likely to have known whether or not they were allocated to the intervention group and most outcomes were self reported. Bias due to attrition was rated high in eight trials and reporting bias was rated high in six. There is evidence that consultation liaison improves mental health for up to three months; and satisfaction and adherence for up to 12 months in people with mental disorders, particularly those who are depressed. Primary care providers were also more likely to provide adequate treatment and prescribe pharmacological therapy for up to 12 months. There was also some evidence that consultation liaison may not be as effective as collaborative care in terms of mental disorder symptoms, disability, general health status, and provision of treatment. However, the overall quality of trials was low particularly in regards to performance and attrition bias and may have resulted in an overestimation of effectiveness. More evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of consultation liaison for people with mental disorders particularly for those with mental disorders other than depression.","In this review of studies published up till March 2014, the effectiveness of consultation liaison was compared to standard primary care and other types of mental health care. We included 12 trials with 2605 consumers and more than 905 primary care providers. Consultation liaison was compared to standard care in 11 trials, and compared to collaborative care in one trial. Collaborative care is mental health care co-ordinated by a primary care case manager. There was some evidence that consultation liaison improved mental health, satisfaction with care and adherence to treatment in people with some mental disorders, particularly those with depression, and improved mental health care by primary care providers. There was also some evidence suggesting consultation liaison may not be as effective as collaborative care. However, as the overall quality of trials was low, the effectiveness of these ways of delivering care may have been overestimated. No conclusions can be made regarding the use of consultation liaison with people who have other mental disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was also no data which could inform practice with specific groups of people such as children and adolescents, and the elderly. More high quality trials of consultation liaison are needed."
CD008045,"Of 785 identified citations, 20 trials from 1990 to 2011 enrolling 1652 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We judged most of the trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias across the six domains, and we judged four studies to have elements of high risk of bias; we did not classify any studies at overall low risk of bias. The quality of evidence was low for five of the seven outcomes (very low N = 1, moderate N = 1) and there was heterogeneity among the studies. There was a variety of adult participants and the procedures were performed by a wide range of differently experienced operators in different situations. There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of the primary outcomes: mortality directly related to the procedure (Peto odds ratio (POR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 2.60, I² = 44%, P = 0.42, 4 studies, 257 participants, low quality evidence); and serious, life-threatening adverse events - intraoperatively: risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.53, I² = 27%, P = 0.78, 12 studies, 1211 participants, low quality evidence,and direct postoperatively: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25, I² = 24%, P = 0.24, 10 studies, 984 participants, low quality evidence. PTs significantly reduce the rate of the secondary outcome, wound infection/stomatitis by 76% (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.37, I² = 0%, P < 0.00001, 12 studies, 936 participants, moderate quality evidence) and the rate of unfavourable scarring by 75% (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.91, I² = 86%, P = 0.04, 6 studies, 789 participants, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of the secondary outcomes, major bleeding (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.09, I² = 47%, P = 0.12, 10 studies, 984 participants, very low quality evidence) and tracheostomy tube occlusion/obstruction, accidental decannulation, difficult tube change (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.82, I² = 22%, P = 0.42, 6 studies, 538 participants, low quality evidence). When compared to STs, PTs significantly reduce the rate of wound infection/stomatitis (moderate quality evidence) and the rate of unfavourable scarring (low quality evidence due to imprecision and heterogeneity). In terms of mortality and the rate of serious adverse events, there was low quality evidence that non-significant positive effects exist for PTs. In terms of the rate of major bleeding, there was very low quality evidence that non-significant positive effects exist for PTs. However, because several groups of participants were excluded from the included studies, the number of participants in the included studies was limited, long-term outcomes were not evaluated, and data on participant-relevant outcomes were either sparse or not available for each study, the results of this meta-analysis are limited and cannot be applied to all critically ill adults.","The evidence is current to May 2015. We included 20 studies from 1990 to 2011, enrolling 1652 adult participants hospitalized in the ICU, who were scheduled for planned tracheotomy. None of the studies were funded. The application of percutaneous techniques, does not reduce the rate of death, of serious, life-threatening complications (e.g. injuries to the windpipe or the oesophagus), major bleeding or problems with the tracheostomy tube (blockage, accidental loss, difficult tube change). There was some evidence that using percutaneous techniques results in fewer cases of wound infections (- 76%) and unfavourable scarring (- 75%). The quality of the evidence varied by outcome from moderate (wound infection) to low (death, serious complications, unfavourable scarring, problems with the tracheostomy tube) and to very low (major bleeding). Reasons for the limitations are: great differences among the studies, results not similar across the studies, and not enough data. Based on the available data, we conclude that percutaneous tracheostomies offer benefits for some of the outcomes when compared with surgical tracheostomies. However, because several groups of participants were excluded from the included studies (i.e. people with unfavourable neck structure, bleeding disorders or emergency situations), the number of participants in the included studies was limited, long-term outcomes were not evaluated, and data on participant-relevant outcomes were either sparse or not available for each study, the results of this meta-analysis are limited and cannot be applied to all critically ill adults."
CD008243,"Two studies (67 participants) were included in the review. Based on the published reports, both studies had potential for bias in several domains. There is some evidence that long intravenous lines are superior to short intravenous lines. One study of 20 participants found that the lifespan of a long intravenous line is longer than that of a short intravenous line, and that participants preferred the long intravenous lines to short intravenous lines. A further study of 47 participants found no difference in lifespan, or participant preference when comparing two different long intravenous lines (the Hydrocath and Vygon EC). Neither study was powered to detect differences in serious complications of the devices. There is some evidence to support the use of long intravenous lines rather than short intravenous lines, in terms of lifespan of the line and patient satisfaction. There is no evidence to suggest that any one type of long intravenous line is superior, and currently choice of line should be determined by operator and patient preference. There are numerous devices available which are used in cystic fibrosis. Further research is required to identify clinically important differences between these devices.","We have found two trials comparing these devices and including 67 participants in total. The studies compared different devices, so we could not pool the information from the two studies. However, one study showed that long intravenous lines last for longer than short intravenous lines (thus reducing the number of procedures which a participant has to undergo for a course of antibiotics). Patient satisfaction was higher with long intravenous lines compared to short intravenous lines. The study comparing two different types of long intravenous line did not show that one type was clearly better than another. Neither study was large enough to show differences in complications for the different devices. Neither study reported on important outcomes, such as the number of attempts required to insert the device. We recommend further research to compare different types of percutaneous long intravenous line."
CD005205,"We included 11 studies with a total of 596 participants. Two studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. The following were all looked at in single studies: oral zinc sulphate compared to placebo, selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D plus vitamin E together versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil (linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control (saturated fatty acids of the same energy value). Two small studies on fish oil suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored. A convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly-registered protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced. There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary supplements in eczema, and they cannot be recommended for the public or for clinical practice at present. Whilst some may argue that at least supplements do not do any harm, high doses of vitamin D may give rise to serious medical problems, and the cost of long-term supplements may also mount up.","We looked for trials comparing supplements with placebo (dummy). We included 11 randomised controlled trials (596 participants) when it was clear that the children or adults taking part had atopic eczema. In reviewing the trials, the main outcomes we looked for were evidence of improvement in the symptoms of eczema, such as itching or loss of sleep, in the short-term (i.e. six weeks). In the longer term, we wanted to see evidence of a reduced need for treatment for the eczema or a reduction in the number of flares. We also looked for evidence of any general improvement in the eczema and in individual symptoms. Overall, we found no convincing evidence that taking supplements improved the eczema of those involved. In general, studies were small with low numbers of participants and of poor quality in terms of the way they were run. Two trials of fish oil did find slight improvement for the participants in terms of the degree of itchiness and quality of life. However, these trials had small numbers, which means they had little chance of finding real differences if they did exist. That is why larger trials are needed before any recommendations can be made. We found no evidence of adverse (harmful) effects in those who took part in the trials. People sometimes think that supplements can at least do no harm; however, high doses of vitamin D, for example, can cause serious medical problems, and the safety of dietary supplements should not be assumed. The cost of supplements can also mount up."
CD005999,"Three studies were eligible for inclusion (n = 339), all of which used agonist protocols. Neither live birth rate nor adverse events were reported by any of the included studies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate between the group who underwent ovarian cyst aspiration and the conservatively managed group (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.29, two RCTs, 159 women, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence). This suggested that if the clinical pregnancy rate in women with conservative management was assumed to be 6%, the chance following cyst aspiration would be between 2% and 22%. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the mean number of follicles recruited (0.55 follicles, 95% CI -0.48 to 1.59, 2 studies, 159 women, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence) mean number of oocytes collected (0.41 oocytes, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.85, 3 studies, 339 women, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or cancellation rate (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.33, one RCT, 122 women, very low quality evidence). The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods, and inconsistent reporting of study findings in one RCT which meant that some of the data could not be used. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether drainage of functional ovarian cysts prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation influences rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, number of follicles recruited, or number of oocytes collected in women with a functional ovarian cyst. The findings of this review do not provide supportive evidence for this approach, particularly in view of the requirement for anaesthesia, extra cost, psychological stress and risk of surgical complications.","Three randomized controlled trials were included involving 339 women of reproductive age who required IVF treatment due to tubal factor infertility, anovulation, male factor infertility, endometriosis or fertility of unknown cause. These studies compared the outcome of IVF cycles in women whose cyst was drained versus the outcomes when the cyst was not drained. The evidence was current to April 2014. None of the included studies reported live birth rates or adverse event rates. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in the pregnancy rate, the number of follicles recruited, or the number of eggs retrieved, between women who had their cyst drained and women who did not. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons, the main reasons for this being small study numbers, low numbers of events and poor reporting of study methods. There was inconsistent reporting of study findings in one RCT, which meant that some of the data could not be used"
CD013850,"We identified three randomised trials for inclusion in our synthesis. All studies were conducted in acute care inpatient settings; the country settings were Canada, Iran and the USA. A total of 955 participants were included across all the studies. There was considerable variation in participants, interventions and measures for quantifying outcomes. We were only able to complete a meta-analysis for one outcome (leadership) and completed a narrative synthesis for other outcomes. We judged all studies as having an unclear risk of bias overall. Collective leadership interventions probably improve leadership (3 RCTs, 955 participants). Collective leadership may improve team performance (1 RCT, 164 participants). We are uncertain about the effect of collective leadership on clinical performance (1 RCT, 60 participants). We are uncertain about the intervention effect on healthcare outcomes, including health status (inpatient mortality) (1 RCT, 60 participants). Collective leadership may slightly improve staff well-being by reducing work-related stress (1 RCT, 164 participants). We identified no direct evidence concerning burnout and psychological symptoms. We are uncertain of the intervention effects on unintended consequences, specifically on staff absence (1 RCT, 60 participants). Collective leadership involves multiple professionals sharing viewpoints and knowledge with the potential to influence positively the quality of care and staff well-being. Our confidence in the effects of collective leadership interventions on professional practice, healthcare outcomes and staff well-being is moderate in leadership outcomes, low in team performance and work-related stress, and very low for clinical performance, inpatient mortality and staff absence outcomes. The evidence was of moderate, low and very low certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision, meaning future evidence may change our interpretation of the results. There is a need for more high-quality studies in this area, with consistent reporting of leadership, team performance, clinical performance, health status and staff well-being outcomes.","We aimed to see whether experiences with collective leadership (as opposed to more centralised and hierarchical leadership styles) improve professional actions, patient health care, and staff well-being. We looked for studies where researchers compared collective leadership with centralised leadership. We collected and analysed all relevant studies with collective leadership interventions characterised by sharing decisions and interactions among health professions. We found three relevant studies (955 participants). The studies were carried out in hospitals in Canada, Iran and the USA. Collective leadership interventions probably improve leadership (3 studies, 955 participants), may improve teamwork (1 study, 164 participants), and may slightly decrease work-related stress (1 study, 164 participants). We do not know if collective leadership has an effect on these outcomes: clinical performance (1 study, 60 participants), inpatient deaths (1 study, 60 participants), and staff absence (1 study, 60 participants). We are moderately confident that collective leadership improves leadership in healthcare settings. The evidence showed that collective leadership had a large effect on leadership strategies. We are less confident in our results about teamwork and work-related stress. We are not confident in the evidence related to clinical performance, inpatient deaths and staff absence. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which intervention they were getting. Not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The evidence is based on few cases. We searched for studies published up to January 2021."
CD011571,"We included five trials (162 randomised participants); three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department. One study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company. Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years. Mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 (i.e. mild) to 23 (i.e. severe) in four studies. Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of participants' characteristics and interventions. None of the trials measured our efficacy primary outcome, time-to-resolution, or the secondary outcome, risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up. We rated the quality of the results as very low-quality evidence, due to high risk of bias (absence of blinding of participants and caregivers, and high risk of outcome reporting bias) and imprecision (single study data with a low number of events). Hence, we are very uncertain about the results presented. Guttate psoriasis
One three-armed trial (N = 43) assessed penicillin (50,000 international units (IU)/kg/day in three doses) versus erythromycin (250 mg four times per day) versus no treatment (treatment for 14 days, with six-week follow-up from start of treatment). Adverse events and the proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin were not measured. One trial (N = 20) assessed penicillin (1.6 MU (million units) intramuscularly once a day) versus no treatment (six weeks of treatment, with eight-week follow-up from start of treatment). At six-week (short-term) follow-up, no adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants with clear or almost clear skin (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 5.85). One trial (N = 20) assessed rifampicin (300 mg twice daily) versus placebo (14-day treatment duration; six-week follow-up from start of treatment); none of the review outcomes were measured. These trials did not measure the proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2. Chronic plaque psoriasis
One trial (N = 50) assessed long-term azithromycin treatment (500 mg daily dose) versus vitamin C. Adverse events were reported in the azithromycin group (10 out of 30 had nausea and mild abdominal upset), but not in the vitamin C group. The proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin was not measured. In the azithromycin group, 18/30 versus 0/20 participants in the vitamin C group reached PASI 75 at the end of 48 weeks of treatment (RR 25.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 393.59). One trial (N = 29) assessed tonsillectomy versus no treatment, with 24-month follow-up after surgery. One participant in the tonsillectomy group had minor bleeding. At eight-week follow-up, 1/15 in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 90; and 3/15 participants in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 75 (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 116.7). We found only five trials (N = 162), which assessed the effects of five comparisons (systemic antibiotic treatment (penicillin, azithromycin) or tonsillectomy). Two comparisons (erythromycin compared to no treatment, and rifampicin compared to placebo) did not measure any of the outcomes of interest. There was very low-quality evidence for the outcomes that were measured, Therefore, we are uncertain of both the efficacy and safety of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis. The included trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and involved only a small number of unrepresentative participants, with limited measurement of our outcomes of interest. The studies did not allow investigation into the influence of Streptococcal infection, and a key intervention (amoxicillin) was not assessed. Further trials assessing the efficacy and tolerance of penicillin V or amoxicillin are needed in children and young adults with guttate psoriasis.","The evidence is current to January 2019. We included five studies (162 participants); three were conducted in hospital dermatology departments. Participants were 12 to 77 years old (100 males; 62 females). One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company. The severity of the condition ranged from mild to severe. Streptococcus bacteria were found in the throats of 14% of people. We classed outcomes measured within eight weeks of the start of treatment as short-term, and those measured at least one year after the start of treatment as long-term. The antibiotic trials in guttate psoriasis patients were all short-term in duration; the antibiotic trial in chronic plaque psoriasis was 48 weeks long. Three studies included participants with guttate psoriasis, and assessed the short-term effects of antibiotics: penicillin (20 participants), or erythromycin compared to no treatment (43 participants), and rifampicin compared to placebo (20 participants). Two studies included participants with chronic plaque psoriasis. One study assessed azithromycin (antibiotic) versus vitamin C at 48 weeks (50 participants); one assessed tonsillectomy versus no intervention at eight weeks and 24 months (29 participants). These results are backed by very low-quality evidence, so we are not certain of their accuracy. Each result is based on only one study. No studies measured our main outcome of interest, the time taken for the skin to be clear or almost clear of lesions, or the risk of relapsing at least once during long-term follow-up. No side effects were seen when penicillin was compared with no treatment in people with guttate psoriasis. Side effects were not measured for the comparisons of rifampicin versus placebo, or erythromycin versus no treatment. In participants with chronic plaque psoriasis, one trial assessed azithromycin versus vitamin C, and 10 participants in the azithromycin group complained of nausea or mild stomach upset. A trial of tonsillectomy versus no treatment reported one case of minor bleeding in the tonsillectomy group. Two studies in participants with chronic plaque psoriasis measured the number of participants achieving a 75% reduction on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75). In one, 18/30 participants in the azithromycin group reached PASI 75 versus none in the vitamin C group. In the other, 3/15 in the tonsillectomy group reached PASI 75 versus none in the no treatment group. The guttate psoriasis trials did not assess this outcome. We are uncertain whether the number of participants with guttate psoriasis achieving clear or almost clear skin differs between those given penicillin and those receiving no treatment. Only one participant with chronic plaque psoriasis achieved almost clear skin in the tonsillectomy group compared to none in the no treatment group. The other three trials did not measure this outcome. Many of our main outcomes were not assessed. Those that were assessed were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are not sure of their accuracy. The studies were very small, and had a high risk of bias because participants and trial assessors were aware of treatment allocation. More studies are needed to see if antibiotic treatment of Streptococcal infection shortens the duration of acute guttate psoriasis, stopping it from turning into a long-term condition (chronic plaque psoriasis)."
CD013620,"We included 32 studies (9058 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 83 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 37.2 to 87.0 years (median: 69.1 years). Participants were largely from acute care settings (including accident and emergency departments). We synthesised data for six comparisons in the review: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces versus: foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces, reactive water surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces, reactive gel surfaces used in the operating room followed by foam surfaces used on the ward bed, and another type of alternating pressure air surface. Of the 32 included studies, 25 (78.1%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcome: pressure ulcer incidence
Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may reduce the proportion of participants developing a new pressure ulcer compared with foam surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.17; I2 = 63%; 4 studies, 2247 participants; low-certainty evidence). Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces applied on both operating tables and hospital beds may reduce the proportion of people developing a new pressure ulcer compared with reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.76; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 415 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the proportion of people developing new pressure ulcers between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and the following surfaces, as all these comparisons have very low-certainty evidence: (1) reactive water surfaces; (2) reactive fibre surfaces; and (3) reactive air surfaces. The comparisons between different types of alternating pressure air surfaces are presented narratively. Overall, all comparisons suggest little to no difference between these surfaces in pressure ulcer incidence (7 studies, 2833 participants; low-certainty evidence). Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer incidence for three comparisons. When time to pressure ulcer development is considered using a hazard ratio (HR), it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of developing new pressure ulcers, over 90 days' follow-up, between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and foam surfaces (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.64; I2 = 86%; 2 studies, 2105 participants; very low-certainty evidence). For the comparison with reactive air surfaces, there is low-certainty evidence that people treated with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may have a higher risk of developing an incident pressure ulcer than those treated with reactive air surfaces over 14 days' follow-up (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.83; 1 study, 308 participants). Neither of the two studies with time to ulcer incidence data suggested a difference in the risk of developing an incident pressure ulcer over 60 days' follow-up between different types of alternating pressure air surfaces. Secondary outcomes
The included studies have data on (1) support-surface-associated patient comfort for comparisons involving foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces; (2) adverse events for comparisons involving foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces; and (3) health-related quality of life outcomes for the comparison involving foam surfaces. However, all these outcomes and comparisons have low or very low-certainty evidence and it is uncertain whether there are any differences in these outcomes. Included studies have data on cost effectiveness for two comparisons. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam surfaces (1 study, 2029 participants) and that alternating pressure (active) air mattresses are probably more cost-effective than overlay versions of this technology for people in acute care settings (1 study, 1971 participants). Current evidence is uncertain about the difference in pressure ulcer incidence between using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and other surfaces (reactive water surfaces, reactive fibre surfaces and reactive air surfaces). Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam surfaces and reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds. People using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces may be more likely to develop new pressure ulcers over 14 days' follow-up than those treated with reactive air surfaces in the nursing home setting; but as the result is sensitive to the choice of outcome measure it should be interpreted cautiously. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than reactive foam surfaces in preventing new pressure ulcers. Future studies should include time-to-event outcomes and assessment of adverse events and trial-level cost-effectiveness. Further review using network meta-analysis adds to the findings reported here.","There are beds, mattresses and mattress toppers specifically designed for people at risk of pressure ulcers. These can be made of a range of materials (such as foam, air cells or water bags) and are divided into two groups:
- reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin, unless a person moves or is repositioned; and
- active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. We wanted to find out if active, air-filled surfaces:
- prevent pressure ulcers;
- are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
- have health benefits that outweigh their costs (cost-effectiveness); and
- have any unwanted effects. We searched the medical literature for studies that evaluated the effects of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers with an active, air-filled surface. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 32 studies (9058 people, average age: 69 years) that lasted between three and 180 days (average: 14 days). The studies compared active, air-filled surfaces with:
- foam, fibre, water-filled or gel surfaces; and
- other air-filled surfaces. Pressure ulcer prevention
The evidence suggests that active, air-filled surfaces may reduce the risk of pressure ulcers developing when compared with:
- foam surfaces;
- gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces used on hospitals beds, for people who undergo surgery. However, active, air-filled surfaces may increase the risk of pressure ulcers developing when compared with reactive air surfaces (1 study, 308 nursing home residents, duration: 14 days). It is unclear if active air-filled surfaces prevent pressure ulcers compared with surfaces other than reactive foam, gel or air-filled surfaces. The type of active, air-filled surface used may make little to no difference for preventing pressure ulcers. Other effects
Active, air-filled surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam. Mattresses with an active, air-filled surface are probably more cost-effective than mattress toppers with the same surface. We did not find sufficiently robust and clear evidence to determine how active, air-filled surfaces affect comfort, quality of life and unwanted effects. Most studies were small (83 people on average) and more than two-thirds of them (25) used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to November 2019."
CD007881,"For the original version of the review, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria and examined either brachytherapy, laser or photodynamic therapy (eight studies) or a variety of pharmacological therapies (nine studies). Overall, there was an absence of credible evidence and the majority of studies were of low methodological quality and at high risk of bias. Brachytherapy in a variety of doses seemed to improve cough in selected participants, suggesting that possibly the lowest effective dose should be used to minimise side effects. Photodynamic therapy was examined in one study and, while improvements in cough were observed, its role in relationship to other therapies for cough was unclear. Some indication of positive effect was observed with morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, levodropropizine, sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate linctus (cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias. For this update, we did not identify any additional trials for inclusion. Two ongoing trials were identified but no study results were available. No new trials were included since the publication of the original version of this review, while 11 new studies that were identified were eventually excluded from this review. Therefore, our conclusions remain unchanged. No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions for the management of cough in cancer.","Hence, the aim of this review was to assess and synthesise the available literature on the management of cough in cancer patients in order to improve practice recommendations. Studies with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. An extensive literature search yielded 17 studies for evaluation. For this update, we did not identify any additional studies for inclusion. Eight of the studies were about the use of brachytherapy (a technique where a radiation source is placed inside the bronchus in the lung for lung cancer or next to the area requiring treatment), use of laser resection or photodynamic therapy (a treatment that uses a drug plus a special type of light to kill cancer cells). Nine studies assessed the effects of a number of different medications, including codeine and morphine. Overall, the research was of poor quality with significant methodological problems, hence no credible evidence was available in the literature to guide practice. Acknowledging these limitations, brachytherapy in a variety of radiation doses was found to be helpful in selected patients. Some pharmacological treatments were found to be helpful, in particular morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, levodropropizine, sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate linctus (a cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias and some reported side effects. No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions for the management of cough in cancer."
CD005449,"Eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients with diabetes were included. Three included studies investigated ticlopidine compared to aspirin or placebo. Five included studies investigated clopidogrel compared to aspirin or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, or compared clopidogrel in combination with aspirin to aspirin alone. All trials included patients with previous CVD except the CHARISMA trial which included patients with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. Overall the risk of bias of the trials was low. The mean duration of follow-up ranged from 365 days to 913 days. Data for diabetes patients on all-cause mortality, vascular mortality and myocardial infarction were only available for one trial (355 patients). This trial compared ticlopidine to placebo and did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences for all-cause mortality, vascular mortality or myocardial infarction. Diabetes outcome data for stroke were available in three trials (31% of total diabetes participants). Overall pooling of two (statistically heterogeneous) studies showed no statistically significant reduction in the combination of fatal and non-fatal stroke (359/3194 (11.2%) versus 356/3146 (11.3%), random effects odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.49) for ADP receptor antagonists versus other antiplatelet drugs. There were no data available from any of the trials on peripheral vascular disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events specifically for patients with diabetes, or costs. The available evidence for ADP receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes mellitus is limited and most trials do not report outcomes for patients with diabetes separately. Therefore, recommendations for the use of ADP receptor antagonists for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes are based on available evidence from trials including patients with and without diabetes. Trials with diabetes patients and subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes in trials with combined populations are needed to provide a more robust evidence base to guide clinical management in patients with diabetes.","This review assessed if these medications would be useful in patients with diabetes. We included eight trials with 21,379 patients and a mean duration of follow-up ranging from 365 to 913 days. Specific data for patients with diabetes were only available in full for one of these trials and partial data were available for two trials. Analysis of the available data demonstrated that adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine) were not more effective than other blood thinning drugs or placebo for death from any cause, death related to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks or strokes. There was no available information on the effects of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists on health-related quality of life, adverse effects specially for people with diabetes, or costs. The use of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes needs to be guided by the information available from trials which included patients with and without diabetes. All future trials on adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists should include data which relate specifically to patients with diabetes in order to inform evidence-based clinical guidelines."
CD004493,"Twenty-seven RCTs were included. The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco, the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. Two interventions were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct interventions were tested only by one RCT. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India. The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care; or school-based interventions provided to all participants. These two groups of studies were considered separately. Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. Although there was heterogeneity between studies there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results. We were unable to extract data from all studies in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis. There was moderate quality evidence family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing smoking when compared to a no intervention control. Nine studies (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data. The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention arms (risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.84). Most of these studies used intensive interventions. Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide. Two studies in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17). Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention only. Of the three studies with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). The other five studies with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis. One RCT also compared a family intervention to a school 'good behaviour' intervention and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388). No studies identified any adverse effects of intervention. There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based interventions can have a positive effect on preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There were more studies of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention, than there were for other compairsons. The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school interventions. Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old. Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting.","We identified 27 trials; 23 in the USA and one each in Australia, India, the Netherlands, and Norway. The focus varied amongst the studies. Fifteen trials focused on substance use prevention: six focused only on tobacco prevention; one focused on alcohol; one on general substance abuse; three on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana; two on alcohol and tobacco; and two on tobacco and cardiovascular health. Two trials focused on HIV and unsafe sex prevention. Ten trials focused on family functioning, child development and modifying adolescent behaviour. Duration of follow-up after the intervention was very varied, ranging from 6 months to over 15 years for the studies which intervened with mothers of very young children. Nine trials provided data to compare a family tobacco intervention to no intervention on future smoking behaviour for those who did not smoke at the start of the study. We could not include data from a further eight trials. The results showed a significant benefit of family-based interventions over the control comparison on preventing experimentation with or taking up regular smoking. Our estimate suggested that family interventions could reduce the number of adolescents who tried smoking at all by between 16 and 32%. Two trials provided data to compare a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention and also favoured the family-based intervention. The estimate suggested that the addition of a family intervention might reduce the onset of smoking by between 4 and 25%. We could not include data from a further five trials. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting. Because most of the randomised controlled trials included in the review did not report their methods in sufficient detail to be confident that the results were not biased, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate, which means that the estimate of effect is uncertain. There is moderate quality evidence that family-based interventions can prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke. Intensive programs may be more likely to be successful than those of lower intensity. There is also evidence to suggest that adding a family-based component to a school intervention may be effective. As the interventions and settings in the review differed considerably, it is important that family-based programmes continue to be evaluated."
CD001005,"Twelve trials were included. They were of variable quality. Limited asthma education did not reduce hospitalisation for asthma (weighted mean difference -0.03 average hospitalisations per person per year, 95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.03). There was no significant effect on doctor visits, lung function and medication use. The effects on asthma symptoms were variable. There was no reduction in days lost from normal activity, but in two studies, perceived asthma symptoms did improve after limited asthma education (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.74). In one study, limited asthma education was associated with reduced emergency department visits (reduction of -2.76 average visits per person per year, 95% confidence interval -4.34 to 1.18). Use of limited asthma education as it has been practiced does not appear to improve health outcomes in adults with asthma although perceived symptoms may improve. Provision of information in the emergency department may be effective, but this needs to be confirmed.","Using a systematic approach, the medical literature was searched thoroughly to find reliable studies that looked at the effects of improving patients' knowledge about asthma, but which did not attempt to improve practical self-management skills. The results of the studies were combined to see if patient education designed to improve patient knowledge about their condition made a difference to their asthma. Improving patient knowledge alone does not seem to reduce hospitalisations, doctor visits or medication use for asthma, but may play a role in improving patients perceptions of their symptoms. However, education programmes designed to improve knowledge alone may reduce Emergency Room visits in high-risk adults."
CD005098,"Fourteen new studies were added in this update resulting in a total of 15 studies reporting data from 561 randomised patients. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years). The distribution of males and females was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies. Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias; six studies at unclear risk of bias; one study at low risk of bias. Ten studies with 407 randomised and 390 analysed patients compared surgical anchorage with conventional anchorage for the primary outcome of mesiodistal movement of upper first molars. We carried out a random-effects model meta-analysis for the seven studies that fully reported this outcome. There was strong evidence of an effect of surgical anchorage on this outcome. Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 mm to -1.09 mm; seven studies, 308 participants analysed) with moderate quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias, one study at low risk of bias). This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical and conventional anchorage (-0.15 years; 95% CI -0.37 years to 0.07 years; three studies, 111 analysed patients) with low quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias and two studies at unclear risk of bias). Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and acceptability was limited and inconclusive. When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another. No included studies reported adverse effects. There is moderate quality evidence that reinforcement of anchorage is more effective with surgical anchorage than conventional anchorage, and that results from mini-screw implants are particularly promising. While surgical anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to extraoral headgear, none of the included studies reported on harms of surgical or conventional anchorage.","The evidence on which this review is based was correct as of 28 October 2013. This is an update to an existing review, which included one study. Fifteen studies were included in this review involving data from 561 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. Most took place in university settings or training hospitals and one in a specialist orthodontic practice. Most studies contained a similar number of males and females, however there were more females than males in five studies and only females in two. The age range varied from adolescents and young adults to adults up to the age of 54 years. All participants in the studies needed a course of orthodontic treatment with additional anchorage control. None of the studies reported adverse effects. When surgically implanted anchorage devices were compared to conventional anchorage devices, they were better in providing stabilisation for preventing unwanted movement in teeth during orthodontic treatment. There was limited information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and how acceptable the devices were found to be. No information was reported on adverse events. The quality of the evidence for the important outcomes in this review ranged from moderate to low quality. The main shortcomings of all of the studies were related to issues with their design and the way they were carried out, with insufficient and low quality reporting of the study methods and outcomes."
CD014909,"We included 21 RCTs analysing 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. None of the included studies had a high risk of bias, but two-thirds of the included studies raised some concerns. This was mainly due to the lack of a predefined analysis plan or missing information about the randomisation process. Most included studies investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. For MBP as well as oAB, the included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage and timing. Data for all predefined outcomes could be extracted from the included studies. However, only four studies reported on side effects of bowel preparation, and none recorded the occurrence of adverse effects such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or the need to discontinue the intervention due to side effects. Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP. The incidence of SSI could be reduced through MBP+oAB by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74; 3917 participants from 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and the risk of anastomotic leakage could be reduced by 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.99; 2356 participants from 10 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). No difference between the two comparison groups was found with regard to mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.82; 639 participants from 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.32; 2013 participants from 6 studies, low-certainty of evidence) and length of hospital stay (MD -0.19, 95% CI -1.81 to 1.44; 621 participants from 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB. No difference was demonstrated between the two treatment alternatives in terms of SSI (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.21; 960 participants from 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence), anastomotic leakage (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.45; 960 participants from 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.50; 709 participants from 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.33; 709 participants from 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) or length of hospital stay (MD 0.1 respectively 0.2, 95% CI -0.68 to 1.08; data from 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (396 participants) compared MBP+oAB versus nBP. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of SSI as well as mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.23 respectively RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.22; low-certainty evidence), while no effect on the risk of anastomotic leakages (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.42; low-certainty evidence), the incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.81; low-certainty evidence) or the length of hospital stay (MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.8 to 1; low-certainty evidence) could be demonstrated. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, our results suggest that MBP+oAB is probably more effective than MBP alone in preventing postoperative complications. In particular, with respect to our primary outcomes, SSI and anastomotic leakage, a lower incidence was demonstrated using MBP+oAB. Whether oAB alone is actually equivalent to MBP+oAB, or leads to a reduction or increase in the risk of postoperative complications, cannot be clarified in light of the low- to very low-certainty evidence. Similarly, it remains unclear whether omitting preoperative bowel preparation leads to an increase in the risk of postoperative complications due to limited evidence. Additional RCTs, particularly on the comparisons of MBP+oAB versus oAB alone or nBP, are needed to assess the impact of oAB alone or nBP compared with MBP+oAB on postoperative complications and to improve confidence in the estimated effect. In addition, RCTs focusing on subgroups (e.g. in relation to type and location of colon resections) or reporting side effects of the intervention are needed to determine the most effective approach of preoperative bowel preparation.","We wanted to find out whether combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation compared with mechanical or oral antibiotic preparation alone or no bowel preparation has an effect on:
- the occurrence of surgical site infections
- the occurrence of anastomotic leakages
In addition, we wanted to find out whether combined bowel preparation had an effect on mortality, the occurrence of mild or severe postoperative complications, the likelihood of postoperative ileus (bowel motility disorder) or the length of hospital stay. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether side effects of the bowel preparation interventions differ between combination therapy and sole mechanical, sole oral antibiotic, or no bowel preparation. We searched for studies comparing combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with sole mechanical, sole oral antibiotic, or no bowel preparation in patients scheduled for colon or rectal resection.We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We included 21 studies in which patients scheduled for colon or rectal resection were assigned either to a group receiving combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation or to a comparison group. The comparison group received mechanical bowel preparation alone in 17 studies, oral antibiotics alone in three studies, and no bowel preparation at all in one study. All participants received intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery. The studies included a total of 5968 participants, of whom 5264 were analysed.Most of the studies were conducted in industrialised countries in Europe or Asia. Bowel preparation was conducted over one to three days before surgery and the follow-up period was 30 days in most of the studies. No industrial funding was reported by any of the studies, but only five of the 21 studies provided information on their funding.Overall, slightly more men (58%) than women (42%) were included. The average age of the study participants varied between 42 and 69 years. We found moderate-certainty evidence that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and leakages without affecting mortality, the occurrence of postoperative ileus or length of hospital stay. When comparing combined bowel preparation with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation, we found low-certainty evidence that there is little to no difference between the compared approaches. There are different reasons why our confidence in the evidence is limited.We are moderately confident in the evidence regarding the reduction of surgical site infections through combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, because different surgical strategies (in terms of surgical access and type and location of bowel resection) and also different methods of bowel preparation (in terms of agent, dose and timing) were used. We are also only moderately confident in the reduction of anastomotic leakage through combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, because just a few cases occurred across the included studies.Regarding the comparison of combination therapy with oral antibiotics alone, we have little confidence in the evidence because not enough studies examined this issue to be certain about the results of our outcomes. In addition, there are some concerns about the methods used in the included studies.As there is only one study, we also have little confidence in the evidence comparing combined bowel preparation with no bowel preparation. This evidence is up-to-date as of December 2021."
CD001710,"Electronic searches identified over 300 citations but none were relevant to this review. We found no trials of non-medical day centres. We feel that the inclusion of any studies less rigorous than randomised trials would result in misleading findings and that it is not unreasonable to expect well designed, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials of day centre care. More precise nomenclature would greatly help identify relevant work. At present non-randomised comparative studies give conflicting messages about the roles provided by day centres and the clinical and social needs they are able to meet. It is therefore probably best that people with serious mental illness and their carers, if given the choice, take a pragmatic decision on which type of unit best meets their needs. There is a clear need for randomised controlled trials of day centre care compared to other forms of day care, and when resources are limited, day centre care within the context of a pragmatic randomised trial may be the only way of ensuring equity of provision.","In this review we sought, but could not find, any evidence from well-conducted randomised trials of the effects of non-medical day centres. Day centres are currently becoming prominent in service planning, but this is not based on good evidence as to their effectiveness for people suffering from severe mental illness. If a choice between facilities is available, people with serious mental illnesses and their carers are currently left to make their own judgements based on the evidence of experience and a few non-randomised studies."
CD008079,"We screened a total of 1150 records. Seven RCTs involving 1763 patients were identified, but only five could be included in the two separate meta-analyses we performed. We judged the overall the quality of these trials as moderate to high. All trials were randomised and open-label studies. However, two trials were published as abstracts only, therefore we were unable to assess the potential risk of bias for these trials in detail. Three RCTs (N = 1421) assessed the efficacy of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies (i.e. rituximab) plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. The meta-analyses showed a statistically significant OS (HR 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.98, P = 0.03, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) was 12) and PFS (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, P < 0.00001) advantage for patients receiving rituximab. In the rituximab-arm occurred more AEs, World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4 (3 trials, N = 1398, RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.23, P < 0.0001; the number needed to harm for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 9), but that did not lead to a statistically significant difference regarding TRM (3 trials, N = 1415, RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.01, P = 0.52). Two trials (N = 177) evaluated rituximab versus alemtuzumab. Neither study reported OS or PFS. There was no statistically significant difference between arms regarding complete response rate (CRR) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.58, P = 0.14) or TRM (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.51, P = 0.15). However, the CLL2007FMP trial was stopped early owing to an increase in mortality in the alemtuzumab arm. More serious AEs occurred in this arm (43% with alemtuzumab versus 22% with rituximab; P = 0.006). Two trials assessed different dosages or time schedules of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies. One trial (N = 104) evaluated two different rituximab schedules (concurrent arm: fludarabine plus rituximab (Flu-R) plus rituximab consolidation versus sequential arm: fludarabine alone plus rituximab consolidation). The comparison of the concurrent versus sequential regimen of rituximab showed a statistically significant difference of the CRR with 33% in the concurrent-arm and 15% in the sequential-arm (P = 0.04), that did not lead to statistically significant differences regarding OS (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.65, P = 0.30) or PFS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.15, P = 0.11). Furthermore results showed no differences in occurring AEs, except for neutropenia, which was more often observed in patients of the concurrent arm. The other trial (N = 61) investigated two different dosages (500 mg and 1000 mg) of ofatumumab in addition to FluC. The arm investigating ofatumumab did not assess OS and a median PFS had not been reached owing to the short median follow-up of eight months. It showed no statistically significant differences between arms regarding CRR (32% in the FCO500 arm versus 50% in the FCO1000 arm; P = 0.10) or AEs (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). This meta-analysis showed that patients receiving chemotherapy plus rituximab benefit in terms of OS as well as PFS compared to those with chemotherapy alone. Therefore, it supports the recommendation of rituximab in combination with FluC as an option for the first-line treatment as well as for the people with relapsed or refractory CLL. The available evidence regarding the other assessed comparisons was not sufficient to deduct final conclusions.","Three trials (N = 1421) were included in the meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy plus rituximab compared to chemotherapy without further therapy. The meta-analysis showed for patients receiving additional rituximab a statistically significant improvement of overall survival and a longer time without progression of the disease. Treatment with rituximab caused more adverse events, but this did not lead to a statistically significant difference regarding death caused by treatment. However, patients who were treated within these trials did not suffer from other severe health problems aside from CLL; therefore, it remains unclear whether patients with severe co-morbidities will benefit from this treatment option. In summary, this meta-analysis showed that patients receiving chemotherapy plus rituximab benefited in terms of survival compared to those with chemotherapy alone. Therefore, it supports the recommendation of rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as an option for the first-line treatment as well as for people with relapsed or refractory CLL. Further research should focus on the evaluation of benefits of adding rituximab to other chemotherapy regimens than fludarabine with cyclophosphamide in the therapy of previously untreated, relapsed or refractory patients. It should also assess whether patients with serious co-morbidities will benefit from the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy. The available evidence regarding assessed comparisons from four other trials was not sufficient to deduct final conclusions.Two trials evaluated polychemotherapy in combination with rituximab versus alemtuzumab respectively. One trial evaluated two different rituximab schedules: rituximab given concurrently with primary treatment plus rituximab therapy given subsequently to the primary treatment versus primary treatment alone with subsequent administration of rituximab. One trial investigated two different dosages (500 mg and 1000 mg) of ofatumumab in addition to fludarabine with cyclophosphamide. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the clinical effects of novel anti-CD20 antibodies, such as ofatumumab or GA101, compared to rituximab. We are aware of 16 ongoing studies, including three trials comparing ofatumumab with or without additional chemotherapy versus no treatment. The findings of these trials will be included in an update of this review and could lead to different conclusions and may allow a judgement on general efficacy and safety of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody in the treatment of CLL."
CD012392,"We include 85 studies in our synthesis. Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income countries and 15 low-income countries, in rural, urban and semi-urban locations. We developed 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context (11 findings, five moderate- or high-confidence); service design and provision (24 findings, 15 moderate- or high-confidence); and what matters to women and staff (17 findings, 11 moderate- or high-confidence) The third domain was sub-divided into two conceptual areas; personalised supportive care, and information and safety. We also developed two lines of argument, using high- or moderate-confidence findings:
For women, initial or continued use of ANC depends on a perception that doing so will be a positive experience. This is a result of the provision of good-quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees and that include continuity of care that is authentically personalised, kind, caring, supportive, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful of women’s need for privacy, and that allow staff to take the time needed to provide relevant support, information and clinical safety for the woman and the baby, as and when they need it. Women’s perceptions of the value of ANC depend on their general beliefs about pregnancy as a healthy or a risky state, and on their reaction to being pregnant, as well as on local socio-cultural norms relating to the advantages or otherwise of antenatal care for healthy pregnancies, and for those with complications. Whether they continue to use ANC or not depends on their experience of ANC design and provision when they access it for the first time. The capacity of healthcare providers to deliver the kind of high-quality, relationship-based, locally accessible ANC that is likely to facilitate access by women depends on the provision of sufficient resources and staffing as well as the time to provide flexible personalised, private appointments that are not overloaded with organisational tasks. Such provision also depends on organisational norms and values that overtly value kind, caring staff who make effective, culturally-appropriate links with local communities, who respect women’s belief that pregnancy is usually a normal life event, but who can recognise and respond to complications when they arise. Healthcare providers also require sufficient training and education to do their job well, as well as an adequate salary, so that they do not need to demand extra informal funds from women and families, to supplement their income, or to fund essential supplies. This review has identified key barriers and facilitators to the uptake (or not) of ANC services by pregnant women, and in the provision (or not) of good-quality ANC by healthcare providers. It complements existing effectiveness reviews of models of ANC provision and adds essential insights into why a particular type of ANC provided in specific local contexts may or may not be acceptable, accessible, or valued by some pregnant women and their families/communities. Those providing and funding services should consider the three thematic domains identified by the review as a basis for service development and improvement. Such developments should include pregnant and postnatal women, community members and other relevant stakeholders.","We include 85 studies in our synthesis. Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of women who were pregnant or who had recently given birth. 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers, including lay or community health workers, and 22 studies included the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income countries and 12 low-income countries, in rural and urban locations. Our findings suggest that women use antenatal care if they find it is a positive experience that fits with their beliefs and values, is easy for them to access, affordable, and treats them as an individual. They want care that helps them to feel that they and their baby are safe, and that is provided by kind, caring, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful staff that have time to give them support and reassurance about the health and well-being of them and their babies. They also value tests and treatments that are offered when they need them, and information and advice that is relevant to them. Our findings also suggest that healthcare staff want to be able to offer this kind of care. They would like to work in antenatal services that are properly funded, and that give them proper support, pay, training and education. They believe this will help them to have enough time to treat each pregnant woman as an individual, and to have the knowledge, skills resources and equipment to do their job well. The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to February 2019."
CD004935,"29 RCTs, with eight weeks to five years follow-up, met our inclusion criteria; four were excluded from the primary meta-analysis because of inadequate outcome data. The remaining 25 trials assessed 1,198 participants, but adequate randomisation was confirmed in only seven trials and concealment of allocation in only one. Only one trial reported deaths, heart attacks and strokes (one of each). Meta-analysis indicated that relaxation resulted in small, statistically significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: -5.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.2 to -2.8, I2 =72%) and DBP (mean difference: -3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.3 to -1.6, I2 =75%) compared to control. The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by duration of follow-up, type of control, type of relaxation therapy or baseline blood pressure. The nine trials that reported blinding of outcome assessors found a non-significant net reduction in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.7 to 1.4, I2 =69%) associated with relaxation. The 15 trials comparing relaxation with sham therapy likewise found a non-significant reduction in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.5 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.1 to 0.2, I2 =63%). In view of the poor quality of included trials and unexplained variation between trials, the evidence in favour of causal association between relaxation and blood pressure reduction is weak. Some of the apparent benefit of relaxation was probably due to aspects of treatment unrelated to relaxation.","Our review pooled findings from 1,198 people with blood pressure over 140/85 mmHg who were enrolled in 25 randomised controlled trials. These trials compared the effect of relaxation either with no treatment or with a dummy treatment which wasn't expected to reduce blood pressure. Overall, relaxation reduced blood pressure by a small amount: the average reduction was 5/3 mmHg, but might be anywhere between 8/5 mmHg and 3/2 mmHg. Different trials gave different − sometimes inconsistent − results. Many of the trials were not well designed or conducted. In the good quality trials, relaxation resulted in smaller average reductions in blood pressure and the results could even be consistent with an average increase in blood pressure. Even when all the trials were put together, the combined group of all the people in all the trials wasn't large enough and the trials didn't run for long enough to tell us whether relaxation could reduce the risk of death, heart attack or stroke. Few people reported side-effects of relaxation and, on average, people were just as likely to report side-effects of the comparison treatment. Different types of relaxation were taught in different trials. It was difficult to disentangle their effects, especially as many trials used a combination of methods. Overall, we found no evidence that autogenic training was effective. Progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive/behavioural therapies and biofeedback seemed to be more likely to reduce blood pressure. However, some of the reduction in blood pressure was almost certainly due to aspects of treatment that were not related to relaxation, such as frequent contact with professionals who were trying to help."
CD002112,"Forty seven randomised controlled trials involving 3448 children (of whom 2210 received desmopressin) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was effective in reducing bed-wetting during treatment, compared with placebo (e.g. 20 µg: 1.34 fewer wet nights per week; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.57), and children were more likely to become dry (e.g. 118/146, 81% versus 140/142, 98% still wet; relative risk (RR) for failure to achieve 14 dry nights with 20 µg was 0.84; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). However, there was no difference between the two patient groups after treatment was finished. There was no clear dose-related effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. In four small trials, there were no significant differences between desmopressin and alarms during treatment when these were used separately, but the chance of failure or relapse after treatment stopped was lower after an alarm in two small trials (40/62, 65% versus 26/57, 46%; RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.91). Although children had fewer wet nights during treatment when they used desmopressin combined with alarm treatment compared with alarms alone (WMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.55), there were no significant differences either in failure rates during treatment (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05) or for relapse after treatment stopped (105/213, 49% versus 118/214, 55%: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08). Comparison with some tricyclic drugs (e.g. amitriptyline) suggested that they might be as effective as desmopressin, although in two trials children were less likely to achieve 14 dry nights with imipramine than desmopressin (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73) but there was not enough information about subsequent relapse. There were more side effects with the tricyclics. Desmopressin may be better than diclofenac or indomethacin. There was not enough information to evaluate the relative effects of behavioural or complementary treatments against desmopressin. Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per week experienced by children, but the limited evidence available suggested that this was not sustained after treatment stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and tricyclics had similar clinical effects during treatment, but that alarms may produce more sustained benefits. However, based on the available limited evidence, these conclusions are only tentative. Children should be advised not to drink more than 240 ml (8 ounces) of fluid during the evening before desmopressin treatment in order to avoid the possible risk of water intoxication.","When desmopressin is used, most of the children have fewer wet nights (one night less on average per week) and more become dry (19% compared with only 2% using dummy treatment in five trials involving 288 children). However, many children start wetting again when treatment stops. On the other hand, more children remain dry when alarm treatment is finished (54% after alarm compared with 35% after desmopressin in two trials involving 119 children). Adding desmopressin to alarm treatment did not result in better cure rates after the end of treatment (51% remained dry after combination treatment compared with 45% after alarm alone). Those using desmopressin (or their parents) should be warned that over-drinking before bedtime should be avoided as this may lead to serious, but rare, adverse effects. Drugs called tricyclic antidepressants have a similar effect to desmopressin and are cheaper, but have more adverse effects. There are few adverse effects with alarms, other than short-term disruption for the family. In summary, alarms take longer to reduce bed-wetting, but their effect may persist longer than desmopressin."
CD011390,"We found no randomised controlled trials on this topic. We included six non-randomised studies (five retrospective) that compared laparoscopic versus open transhiatal oesophagectomy (334 patients: laparoscopic = 154 patients; open = 180 patients); five studies (326 patients: laparoscopic = 151 patients; open = 175 patients) provided information for one or more outcomes. Most studies included a mixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and different stages of oesophageal cancer, without metastases. All the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias; the overall quality of evidence was very low for all the outcomes. The differences between laparoscopic and open transhiatal oesophagectomy were imprecise for short-term mortality (laparoscopic = 0/151 (adjusted proportion based on meta-analysis estimate: 0.5%) versus open = 2/175 (1.1%); RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.09; participants = 326; studies = 5; I² = 0%); long-term mortality (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; participants = 193; studies = 2; I² = 0%); anastomotic stenosis (laparoscopic = 4/36 (11.1%) versus open = 3/37 (8.1%); RR 1.37; 95% CI 0.33 to 5.70; participants = 73; studies = 1); short-term recurrence (laparoscopic = 1/16 (6.3%) versus open = 0/4 (0%); RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.04 to 18.47; participants = 20; studies = 1); long-term recurrence (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18; participants = 173; studies = 2); proportion of people who required blood transfusion (laparoscopic = 0/36 (0%) versus open = 6/37 (16.2%); RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.35; participants = 73; studies = 1); proportion of people with positive resection margins (laparoscopic = 15/102 (15.8%) versus open = 27/111 (24.3%); RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.12; participants = 213; studies = 3; I² = 0%); and the number of lymph nodes harvested during surgery (median difference between the groups varied from 12 less to 3 more lymph nodes in the laparoscopic compared to the open group; participants = 326; studies = 5). The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was lower in the laparoscopic group (10/99, (10.3%) compared to the open group = 24/114 (21.1%); RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.99; participants = 213; studies = 3; I² = 0%); as it was for adverse events in the laparoscopic group = 37/99 (39.9%) versus the open group = 71/114 (62.3%); RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; participants = 213; studies = 3; I² = 0%); and the median lengths of hospital stay were significantly less in the laparoscopic group than the open group (three days less in all three studies that reported this outcome; number of participants = 266). There was lack of clarity as to whether the median difference in the quantity of blood transfused was statistically significant favouring laparoscopic oesophagectomy in the only study that reported this information. None of the studies reported post-operative dysphagia, health-related quality of life, time-to-return to normal activity (return to pre-operative mobility without caregiver support), or time-to-return to work. There are currently no randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic with open transhiatal oesophagectomy for patients with oesophageal cancers. In observational studies, laparoscopic transhiatal oesophagectomy is associated with fewer overall complications and shorter hospital stays than open transhiatal oesophagectomy. However, this association is unlikely to be causal. There is currently no information to determine a causal association in the differences between the two surgical approaches. Randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic transhiatal oesophagectomy with other methods of oesophagectomy are required to determine the optimal method of oesophagectomy.","Randomised controlled trials are the best types of studies to find out whether one treatment is better than another since it ensures that similar types of people receive the new and the old treatment. But we did not find randomised controlled trials; we identified six relevant non-randomised studies with a total of 334 patients, which compared laparoscopic and open surgeries. Since one of the studies did not provide usable results, five studies, with 326 patients, provided information for this review; laparoscopic surgery = 151 patients and open surgery = 175 patients. In four of these studies, historical information was collected from hospital records. In one study, new information was collected. In general, new information is considered to be more reliable than information from hospital records. The differences between laparoscopic and open transhiatal oesophagectomy were imprecise for: deaths during the short-term and long-term, the percentage of people with major complications, narrowing of the new junction between the gut, created after removing the oesophagus, cancer returning during the short-term and long-term, and the proportion of people who required blood transfusion. The proportion of patients with any complications and the average lengths of hospital stay were less in the key-hole group than the open cut group. There was lack of clarity about the difference in the amount of blood transfused between the two groups. None of the studies reported difficulty in swallowing after surgery, health-related quality of life, the amount of time it took to return to normal activity (same mobility as before surgery), or work. The quality of the evidence was very low. This was mainly because it was not clear whether participants who received laparoscopic surgery were similar to those who had open surgery. This makes the findings unreliable. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are necessary to obtain high-quality evidence on the best method to perform oesophagectomy."

Facilitated tucking probably reduces Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score during endotracheal suctioning (MD −2.76, 95% CI 3.57 to 1.96; I² = 82%; 4 studies, 148 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Facilitated tucking probably has little or no effect during endotracheal suctioning on: heart rate (MD −3.06 beats per minute (bpm), 95% CI −9.33 to 3.21; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 80 infants; low-certainty evidence); oxygen saturation (MD 0.87, 95% CI −1.33 to 3.08; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 80 infants; low-certainty evidence); or stress and defensive behaviours (SDB) (MD −1.20, 95% CI −3.47 to 1.07; 1 study, 20 infants; low-certainty evidence). Facilitated tucking may result in a slight increase in self-regulatory behaviours (SRB) during endotracheal suctioning (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.60; 1 study, 20 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). Familiar odour versus standard care (one study)
Familiar odour during endotracheal suctioning probably has little or no effect on: PIPP score (MD −0.30, 95% CI −2.15 to 1.55; 1 study, 40 infants; low-certainty evidence); heart rate (MD −6.30 bpm, 95% CI −16.04 to 3.44; 1 study, 40 infants; low-certainty evidence); or oxygen saturation during endotracheal suctioning (MD −0.80, 95% CI −4.82 to 3.22; 1 study, 40 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported SRB, SDB or IVH. White noise (one study)
White noise during endotracheal suctioning probably has little or no effect on PIPP (MD −0.65, 95% CI −2.51 to 1.21; 1 study, 40 infants; low-certainty evidence); heart rate (MD −1.85 bpm, 95% CI −11.46 to 7.76; 1 study, 40 infants; low-certainty evidence); or oxygen saturation (MD 2.25, 95% CI −2.03 to 6.53; 1 study, 40 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported SRB, SDB or IVH. Facilitated tucking / four-handed care / gentle human touch probably reduces PIPP score. The evidence of a single study suggests that facilitated tucking / four-handed care / gentle human touch slightly increases self-regulatory and approach behaviours during endotracheal suctioning. Based on a single study, familiar odour and white noise have little or no effect on any of the outcomes compared to no intervention. The use of expressed breast milk or oral sucrose suggests that there is no discernible advantage of one method over the other for reducing pain during endotracheal suctioning. None of the studies reported on any of the prespecified secondary outcomes of adverse events.","We wanted to find out how to reduce infants' pain during endotracheal suctioning without using medicines. We searched medical databases for clinical studies looking at ways to reduce infants' pain during endotracheal suctioning. We found eight studies of 386 infants. We assessed six different ways of reducing infants' pain during endotracheal suctioning without using medicines, such as:
– gently holding the infant in a facilitated tucking position;
– familiar odour (breast milk smell);
– use of a sugar solution (sucrose);
– use of expressed breast milk;
– white noise;
– swaddling. In ventilated newborn infants
Facilitated tucking probably reduces pain during endotracheal suctioning. Familiar odour and white noise have little or no effect during endotracheal suctioning. The use of expressed breast milk or oral sucrose suggests that there is no real advantage of one method over the other for reducing pain during endotracheal suctioning. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results in the review, and the staff were aware of which method was used to reduce pain. More studies are needed to support these results. The evidence is up to date to 21 June 2023."
CD014615,"We included eight eligible studies with 1766 women. All studies reported some form of random sequence generation but were at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. There was a high risk of selection bias in one study, detection bias in two studies, attrition bias in two studies, and reporting bias in two studies. Hands and knees
The use of hands and knees posture may have little to no effect on operative birth (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; 3 trials, 721 women; low-certainty evidence) and caesarean section (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 3 trials, 721 women; low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain; and very uncertain for epidural use (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.31; 2 trials, 282 women; very low-certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; 3 trials, 721 women; very low-certainty evidence), severe perineal tears (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.03 to 22.30; 2 trials, 586 women; very low-certainty evidence), maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.54; 3 trials, 350 women; very low-certainty evidence), and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; 2 trials, 586 babies; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for the hands and knees comparisons for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. Lateral postures
The use of lateral postures may have little to no effect on reducing operative birth (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.19; 4 trials, 871 women; low-certainty evidence), caesarean section (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.39; 4 trials, 871 women; low-certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36; 4 trials, 871 women; low-certainty evidence), and maternal satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 2 trials, 451 women; low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lateral postures on severe perineal tears (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; 3 trials, 609 women; very low-certainty evidence), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 1 trial, 322 women; very low-certainty evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 3 trials, 752 babies; very low-certainty evidence), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 1 trial, 322 babies; very low-certainty evidence), admissions to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 2 trials, 542 babies; very low-certainty evidence) and neonatal death (stillbirth or death of liveborn) (1 trial, 210 women and their babies; no events). For the lateral posture comparisons, no data were reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. We were not able to estimate the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) due to no events (1 trial, 210 participants). We found low- and very low-certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no effect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant. If a woman finds the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour. Trials should include further assessment of semi-prone postures, same-side-as-fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion, or both, and consider interventions of longer duration or that involve the early second stage of labour.","We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies  in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies. Women in the included studies were either first-time mothers or mothers who had birthed before. All the women's  pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks. The trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side-lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi-prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby). For both the hands and knees posture and side-lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side-lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side-lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long-term outcomes for women and their babies."
CD011285,"We included eight new studies in the current review, which now includes 14 RCTs. We extracted data from 11 studies. The studies had low- to moderate-certainty evidence with evidence downgraded due to inconsistencies in the data and performance bias. The total number of participants in meta-analyses comparing exercise-based rehabilitation to control groups was 462. The mean age of the participants in the 14 RCTs ranged from 35 to 68 years. Most participants were women and classified as Group I pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Study durations ranged from 3 to 25 weeks. Exercise-based programmes included both inpatient- and outpatient-based rehabilitation that incorporated both upper and lower limb exercise. The mean six-minute walk distance following exercise-based rehabilitation was 48.52 metres higher than control (95% confidence interval (CI) 33.42 to 63.62; I² = 72%; 11 studies, 418 participants; low-certainty evidence), the mean peak oxygen uptake was 2.07 mL/kg/min higher than control (95% CI 1.57 to 2.57; I² = 67%; 7 studies, 314 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the mean peak power was 9.69 W higher than control (95% CI 5.52 to 13.85; I² = 71%; 5 studies, 226 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported five serious adverse events; however, exercise-based rehabilitation was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse event (risk difference 0, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.03; I² = 0%; 11 studies, 439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The mean change in HRQoL for the 36-item Short Form (SF-36) Physical Component Score was 3.98 points higher (95% CI 1.89 to 6.07; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 187 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and for the SF-36 Mental Component Score was 3.60 points higher (95% CI 1.21 to 5.98 points; I² = 0%; 5 RCTs, 186 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were similar effects in the subgroup analyses for participants with Group 1 PH versus studies of groups with mixed PH. Two studies reported mean reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure following exercise-based rehabilitation (mean reduction: 9.29 mmHg, 95% CI −12.96 to −5.61; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 133 participants; low-certainty evidence). In people with PH, supervised exercise-based rehabilitation may result in a large increase in exercise capacity. Changes in exercise capacity remain heterogeneous and cannot be explained by subgroup analysis. It is likely that exercise-based rehabilitation increases HRQoL and is probably not associated with an increased risk of a serious adverse events. Exercise training may result in a large reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Overall, we assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low for exercise capacity and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and moderate for HRQoL and adverse events. Future RCTs are needed to inform the application of exercise-based rehabilitation across the spectrum of people with PH, including those with chronic thromboembolic PH, PH with left-sided heart disease and those with more severe disease.","We wanted to review the evidence from well-designed clinical trials that compared exercise-based rehabilitation with usual care. We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing exercise training versus usual care in people with PH to see if exercise improved short- and long-term outcomes such as exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, serious side effects and changes in the pressure in the pulmonary circulation. The updated review included 14 studies with 574 people, and we included data from 11 studies in analyses (462 participants). The studies reported that exercise-based rehabilitation may result in large increases in exercise capacity as evaluated by how far people could walk in six minutes and maximal oxygen consumption using a specialised exercise test; however, there was marked variability in this response. Health-related quality of life was also most likely to be improved and exercise-based rehabilitation may also result in a large reduction in the pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Serious side effects were rare and exercise-based rehabilitation was unlikely to increase the risk of them. The evidence from these trials was of low to moderate quality. The main limitations in the studies was a lack of allocation concealment (participants knew whether they were in the exercise group or not, which could cause bias) and studies did not report the results of all the outcome data. In addition, some outcomes, for example exercise capacity, had a variable response, which we could not explain by examining different subgroups of people. The evidence is current to 28 June 2022."
CD012540,"A total of six RCTs (326 patients) evaluating therapeutic discontinuation in patients with quiescent CD were eligible for inclusion. In four RCTs azathioprine monotherapy was discontinued, and in two RCTs azathioprine was discontinued from a combination therapy regimen consisting of azathioprine with infliximab. No studies of biologic monotherapy withdrawal were eligible for inclusion. The majority of studies received unclear or low risk of bias ratings, with the exception of three open-label RCTs, which were rated as high risk of bias for blinding. Four RCTs (215 participants) compared discontinuation to continuation of azathioprine monotherapy, while two studies (125 participants) compared discontinuation of azathioprine from a combination regimen to continuation of combination therapy. Continuation of azathioprine monotherapy was shown to be superior to withdrawal for risk of clinical relapse. Thirty-two per cent (36/111) of azathioprine withdrawal participants relapsed compared to 14% (14/104) of participants who continued with azathioprine therapy (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, GRADE low quality evidence). However, it is uncertain if there are any between-group differences in new CD-related complications (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08, GRADE low quality evidence), adverse events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, GRADE low quality evidence), serious adverse events (RR 3.29, 95% CI 0.35 to 30.80, GRADE low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 19.04, GRADE low quality evidence). Common adverse events included infections, mild leukopenia, abdominal symptoms, arthralgias, headache and elevated liver enzymes. No differences between azathioprine withdrawal from combination therapy versus continuation of combination therapy were observed for clinical relapse. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52, P = 0.32; GRADE low quality evidence). The effects on adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.81, GRADE low quality of evidence) or serious adverse events are uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; GRADE very low quality of evidence). Common adverse events in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, arthralgias and infusion reactions. The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in people with quiescent Crohn's disease are uncertain. Low quality evidence suggests that continuing azathioprine monotherapy may be superior to withdrawal for avoiding clinical relapse, while very low quality evidence suggests that there may be no difference in clinical relapse rates between discontinuing azathioprine from a combination therapy regimen, compared to continuing combination therapy. It is unclear whether withdrawal of azathioprine, initially administered alone or in combination, impacts on the development of CD-related complications, adverse events, serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Further high-quality research is needed in this area, particularly double-blind RCTs in which biologic therapy or an immunosuppressant other than azathioprine is withdrawn.","We performed a comprehensive literature review and identified six randomized controlled trials (an experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to receive two or more interventions and the results are compared) that involved a total of 326 participants. Four of the six studies assigned patients who had been receiving azathioprine alone to either continue or discontinue therapy (215 participants). Two of the six studies assigned patients who had been receiving azathioprine in addition to infliximab to continue therapy or discontinue azathioprine (111 participants). Clinical relapse occurred in 13% (14/104) of patients who continued azathioprine monotherapy compared to 32% (36/111) of patients who discontinued azathioprine monotherapy. No differences were observed for Crohn's disease-related complications, side effects, serious side effects and withdrawal due to side effects. Common side effects included infections, mild decrease in the number of white blood cells, abdominal symptoms, joint pain, headache and elevated liver enzymes. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab. No differences in side effects, serious side effects or withdrawal due to side effects were observed. Common side effects reported in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, joint pain and infusion reactions (a hypersensitivity reaction to the biologic medication). Overall, the quality of evidence for each outcome was low due to a high risk of study bias and small numbers of patients evaluated. The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in people with Crohn's disease in remission are uncertain. Low quality evidence suggests that continuing azathioprine monotherapy may be superior to withdrawal of azathioprine for avoiding clinical relapse in people with Crohn's disease in remission. Low quality evidence suggests that stopping the immunosuppressive after combination therapy does not seem to impact on the risk of relapsing. It is unclear whether the withdrawal of azathioprine, initially administered alone or in combination, impacts on the development of Crohn's disease-related complications, side effects, serious side effects, or withdrawal from the studies due to side effects. Additional research is needed in this area to better inform clinical practice, particularly high-quality randomized controlled trials examining outcomes when biologic therapy is withdrawn."
CD003483,"We included nine trials, with 316 participants in total, that compared the effects of naloxone versus placebo or no drug in newborn infants exposed to maternal opioid analgesia prior to delivery. None of the included trials investigated infants born to mothers who had used a prescribed or non-prescribed opioid during pregnancy. None of these trials specifically recruited infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression. The main outcomes reported were measures of respiratory function in the first six hours after birth. There is some evidence that naloxone increases alveolar ventilation. The trials did not assess the effect on the primary outcomes of this review (admission to a neonatal unit and failure to establish breastfeeding). The existing evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to determine whether naloxone confers any important benefits to newborn infants with cardiorespiratory or neurological depression that may be due to intrauterine exposure to opioid. Given concerns about the safety of naloxone in this context, it may be appropriate to limit its use to randomised controlled trials that aim to resolve these uncertainties.","We found nine completed trials that compared giving to newborn babies, whose mothers had received opioids during labour, either naloxone or a placebo ('dummy drug'). These trials were conducted more than 30 years ago and they were generally very small including only about 300 infants in total. Most of the trials did not use reliable methods consistently. Evidence is up-to-date as of February 2018. The trials reported the effects of naloxone on the baby's breathing but did not assess the effect on the need for babies to be cared for in a neonatal unit (separated from their mother), whether they needed help with breathing, or on breastfeeding success. None of the trials assessed long-term development. We did not find any trials including babies born to mothers who had used opioids (whether prescribed or non-prescribed) during pregnancy. The available evidence was not sufficient to determine whether giving naloxone to babies whose mothers received opioids during birth was helpful or harmful."
CD006897,"Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis. Mean ages of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more). No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more). Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37). In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)). Length of hospital stay (n = 421; mean difference (MD) -0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28) and lung function at the end of treatment (n = 185; MD FEV1 -0.04 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10) did not differ between short-duration and longer-duration treatment. Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates. The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.","We found eight studies that included 582 people with COPD who experienced a flare-up that required extra treatment in hospital. These studies compared oral or injected corticosteroid treatment given for seven or fewer days versus treatment for longer than seven days. Most of the people in these studies were in their late sixties and had severe or very severe symptoms of COPD; more men than women took part. The last search for studies to be included in the review was conducted in March 2017. No differences were observed between shorter and longer courses of treatment. People treated for seven or fewer days did not have a higher rate of treatment failure or longer time to their next exacerbation; the number of people who avoided treatment failure ranged from 51 fewer to 34 more per 1000 treated (average 22 fewer people per 1000). Time in hospital and lung function (blowing tests) at the end of treatment were not different. No differences in side effects or death were noted between treatments. Information on quality of life, which is an important outcome for people with COPD, is limited, as only one study measured it. The eight studies included in this review were generally well designed, and the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate because of imprecision in results; more research, especially involving people with less severe COPD, is needed."
CD000277,"Sixteen trials, involving 3361 patients, were included in the review; three of the studies were of magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine. Overall, calcium antagonists reduced the risk of poor outcome: the relative risk (RR) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92); the corresponding number of patients needed to treat was 19 (95% CI 1 to 51). For oral nimodipine alone the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81), for other calcium antagonists or intravenous administration of nimodipine the results were not statistically significant. Calcium antagonists reduced the occurrence of secondary ischaemia and showed a favourable trend for case fatality. For magnesium in addition to standard treatment with nimodipine, the RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00) for a poor outcome and 0.66 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.96) for clinical signs of secondary ischaemia. Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH. The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. Magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.","This review of 16 trials, involving 3361 patients, has found that the outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage, in terms of survival and being independent in activities of daily living, is improved by treatment with calcium channel blockers (antagonists). If the largest trial is excluded from the analysis, the results are no longer statistically significant, and therefore the evidence is not beyond all doubt. However, given the high likelihood of benefits and the modest risks associated with this treatment, the review authors conclude that calcium antagonists, in the form of oral nimodipine 60 mg every four hours, are useful in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Magnesium is another calcium antagonist with promising results, but larger trials with this drug are needed before we can be certain about a beneficial effect."
CD010108,"Nine Cochrane reviews were selected for this overview. Their scores on the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire varied from four to six of a maximal possible score of seven. Compared with general anaesthesia, neuraxial blockade reduced the zero to 30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 0.94; I2 = 0%) based on 20 studies that included 3006 participants. Neuraxial blockade also decreased the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.79; I2 = 0%) based on five studies that included 400 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between the two techniques (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.37; I2 = 0%) based on six studies with 849 participants. Compared with general anaesthesia alone, the addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia did not affect the zero to 30-day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.51; I2 = 0%) based on 18 studies with 3228 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between combined neuraxial blockade-general anaesthesia and general anaesthesia alone (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; I2 = 0%) based on eight studies that included 1580 participants. The addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia reduced the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.98; I2 = 9%) after adjustment for publication bias and based on nine studies that included 2433 participants. The quality of the evidence was judged as moderate for all six comparisons. No serious adverse events (seizure or cardiac arrest related to local anaesthetic toxicity, prolonged central or peripheral neurological injury lasting longer than one month or infection secondary to neuraxial blockade) were reported. The quality of the reporting score of complications related to neuraxial blocks was nine (four to 12 (median range)) of a possible maximum score of 14. Compared with general anaesthesia, a central neuraxial block may reduce the zero to 30-day mortality for patients undergoing surgery with intermediate to high cardiac risk (level of evidence, moderate). Further research is required.","When epidurals or spinals were used to replace general anaesthesia, the risk of dying during the surgery or within the following 30 days was reduced by approximately 29% (from 20 studies with 3006 participants). Also, the risk of developing pneumonia (chest infection) was reduced by 55% (from five studies with 400 participants). However, the risk of developing a myocardial infarction (heart attack) was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from six studies with 849 participants). When epidurals (and less frequently spinals) were used to reduce the quantity of other drugs required while general anaesthesia was used, the risk of dying during the surgery or within 30 days was the same for both anaesthetic techniques (from 18 studies with 3228 participants). Also, a difference was not detected for the risk of developing myocardial infarction (from eight studies with 1580 participants). The risk of developing pneumonia was reduced by approximately 30% when a correction was made for possible missing studies (from nine studies with 2433 participants). No serious side effects (seizures, cardiac arrest, nerve damage lasting longer than one month or infection) were reported from the use of epidurals or spinals in these studies. The quality of the evidence for all six comparisons was rated as moderate because of some imperfections in how the studies were carried out. Therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these results and may even change the results. ."
CD004889,"Five randomised clinical trials, including 330 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The majority of trials had adequate allocation concealment, but only one employed blinded outcome assessment. Mortality at 30-days (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 10.06, P = 1.0) and 24-months (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.56, P = 0.5) did not differ significantly between TIPS and paracentesis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts significantly reduced the re-accumulation of ascites at 3-months (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18, P < 0.01) and 12-months (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28, P < 0.01). Hepatic encephalopathy occurred significantly more often in the TIPS group (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.6, P < 0.01), but gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and acute renal failure did not differ significantly between the two groups. The meta-analysis supports that TIPS was more effective at removing ascites as compared with paracentesis without a significant difference in mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and acute renal failure. However, TIPS patients develop hepatic encephalopathy significantly more often.","Randomised trials have compared transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts with paracentesis. Mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, or infection did not differ significantly between the two intervention groups. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts effectively decreased the risk of ascites fluid re-accumulation, but was associated with an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy."
CD010037,"The 2020 updated search identified four new trials. We included a total of 20 trials with 3512 participants, however we only included 18 for the meta-analysis with 3140 participants. None of the studies reported hypertension as a dichotomous outcome. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was: mean difference (MD) -1.37 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.08, -0.66; 3140 participants; 18 studies; I2 = 0%, high-certainty evidence; and MD -1.45, 95% CI -2.23, -0.67; 3039 participants; 17 studies; I2 = 45%, high-certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those younger than 35 years was: MD -1.86, 95% CI -3.45, -0.27; 452 participants; eight studies; I2 = 19%, moderate-certainty evidence; MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.22, -0.79; 351 participants; seven studies ; I2 = 54%, moderate-certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those 35 years or older was: MD -0.97, 95% CI -1.83, -0.10; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 0%, high-certainty evidence; MD -0.59, 95% CI -1.13, -0.06; 2688 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 0%, high-certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women was: MD -1.25, 95% CI -2.53, 0.03; 1915 participants; eight studies; I2 = 0%, high-certainty evidence; MD -1.04, 95% CI -1.86, -0.22; 1915 participants; eight studies; I2 = 4%, high-certainty evidence, respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for men was MD -2.14, 95% CI -3.71, -0.59; 507 participants; five studies; I2 = 8%, moderate-certainty evidence; MD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25, -0.74; 507 participants; five studies; I2 = 41%, moderate-certainty evidence, respectively. The effect was consistent in both genders regardless of baseline calcium intake. The effect on systolic blood pressure was: MD -0.02, 95% CI -2.23, 2.20; 302 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence with doses less than 1000 mg; MD -1.05, 95% CI -1.91, -0.19; 2488 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%, high-certainty evidence with doses 1000 to 1500 mg; and MD -2.79, 95% CI -4.71, 0.86; 350 participants; 7 studies; I2 = 0%, moderate-certainty evidence with doses more than 1500 mg. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was: MD -0.41, 95% CI -2.07, 1.25; 201 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0, moderate-certainty evidence; MD -2.03, 95% CI -3.44, -0.62 ; 1017 participants; 8 studies; and MD -1.35, 95% CI -2.75, -0.05; 1821 participants; 8 studies; I2 = 51%, high-certainty evidence, respectively. None of the studies reported adverse events. An increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normotensive people, particularly in young people, suggesting a role in the prevention of hypertension. The effect across multiple prespecified subgroups and a possible dose response effect reinforce this conclusion. Even small reductions in blood pressure could have important health implications for reducing vascular disease. A 2 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure is predicted to produce about 10% lower stroke mortality and about 7% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease. There is a great need for adequately-powered clinical trials randomising young people. Subgroup analysis should involve basal calcium intake, age, sex, basal blood pressure, and body mass index. We also require assessment of side effects, optimal doses and the best strategy to improve calcium intake.","We selected studies that assessed the effect of dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification on blood pressure in normotensive people of all ages. Searches were last run in September 2020. This review analysed information from 20 trials of which 18 trials (3140participants) provided date for the effect of the intervention. We found that an increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1.37 mmHg lower and by 1.45 mmHg lower, respectively. This effect was higher with doses of calcium above 1000 mg/day. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.05 mmHg with doses of calcium 1000 to 1500 mg/day and by 2.79 mmHg with doses of calcium equal to or over 1500 mg/day. We noted a reduction in blood pressure in both men and women and at ages from 11 to 82 years old, but the reduction was greater among younger people. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.86 mmHg among those less than 35 years and by 0.97 mmHg among those 35 years or older. None of the studies reported adverse events. We need further research to determine the ideal dosage of supplementation and whether it is more effective and safer as part of the diet or as a supplement. We found high quality of evidence for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both men and women. The quality of evidence was also high for participants 35 years or older and moderate for younger people. The quality of evidence was high for doses of calcium of 1000 to 1500 mg/day and was moderate for lower or higher doses. Five of the 18 trials were industry funded."
CD003338,"Twenty-three studies (2344 participants) were included in this update, including nine new studies. A broad variety of conservative interventions were evaluated. Two studies included patients with chronic symptoms (longer than three months), two included subacute (four to six weeks) symptoms, two had undefined duration of symptoms, and 17 studied patients with acute (less than three weeks) symptoms. Only eight studies (33.3%) satisfied one of our criteria of high quality, indicating overall, a poor methodological quality. Interventions were divided into passive (such as rest, immobilisation, ultrasound, etc) and active interventions (such as exercises, act as usual approach, etc.) and were compared with no treatment, a placebo or each other. Clinical and statistical heterogeneity and lack of data precluded pooling. Individual studies demonstrated effectiveness of one treatment over another, but the comparisons were varied and results inconsistent. Therefore, the evidence neither supports nor refutes the effectiveness of either passive or active treatments to relieve the symptoms of WAD, Grades 1 or 2. The current literature is of poor methodological quality and is insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results. Therefore, clearly effective treatments are not supported at this time for the treatment of acute, subacute or chronic symptoms of whiplash-associated disorders.","We included 23 studies (2344 participants with WAD Grades 1 or 2), nine of which were new for this update. Overall, the methodological quality was poor and the studies included populations and interventions that were too different to pool. Two studies examined treatments for patients with chronic pain (longer than three months), two looked at subacute pain (four to six weeks), two were unclear (but one was probably chronic), and the rest looked at patients with acute symptoms of less than three weeks. In 11 studies, an active treatment approach (treatment strategy including exercises or advice to 'act as usual') was compared to a passive strategy, no treatment or was an additional treatment. Eight studies compared an active intervention with a passive one (the patient received a treatment such as advice to rest and wear a neck collar, an educational video, electrotherapy, manipulation, hot and cold packs, traction, or acupuncture). Eight studies compared an intervention with a placebo or no treatment. In seven studies, two active treatments were compared against each other and in one, a passive intervention was compared to injections. Since we were unable to pool any of the studies, we remain unable to either support or refute the effects of conservative treatments for acute, subacute or chronic whiplash-associated disorders with the current evidence."
CD006663,"Nine trials comparing either agalsidase alfa or beta in 351 participants fulfilled the selection criteria. Both trials comparing agalsidase alfa to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue; aggregate results were non-significant. One trial reported pain scores measured by the Brief Pain Inventory severity, there was a statistically significant improvement for participants receiving treatment at up to three months, mean difference -2.10 (95% confidence interval -3.79 to -0.41; at up to five months, mean difference -1.90 (95% confidence interval -3.65 to -0.15); and at up to six months, mean difference -2.00 (95% confidence interval -3.66 to -0.34). There was a significant difference in the Brief Pain Inventory pain-related quality of life at over five months and up to six months, mean difference -2.10 (95% confidence interval -3.92 to -0.28) but not at other time points. Death was not an outcome in either of the trials. One of the three trials comparing agalsidase beta to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue and showed significant improvement: kidney, mean difference -1.70 (95% confidence interval -2.09 to -1.31); heart, mean difference -0.90 (95% confidence interval -1.18 to -0.62); and composite results (renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications and death), mean difference -4.80 (95% confidence interval -5.45 to -4.15). There was no significant difference between groups for death; no trials reported on pain. Only two trials compared agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta. One of them showed no significant difference between the groups regarding adverse events, risk ratio 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 1.59), or any serious adverse events; risk ratio 0.30; (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 2.57). Two trials compared different dosing schedules of agalsidase alfa. One of them involved three different doses (0.2 mg/kg every two weeks; 0.1 mg/kg weekly and; 0.2 mg/kg weekly), the other trial evaluated two further doses to the dosage schedules: 0.4 mg/kg every week and every other week. Both trials failed to show significant differences with various dosing schedules on globotriaosylceramide levels. No significant differences were found among the schedules for the primary efficacy outcome of self-assessed health state, or for pain scores. One trial comparing agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta showed no significant difference for any adverse events such as dyspnoea and hypertension. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally unclear for the random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Trials comparing enzyme replacement therapy to placebo show significant improvement with enzyme replacement therapy in regard to microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide and in pain-related quality of life. There is, however, no evidence identifying if the alfa or beta form is superior or the optimal dose or frequency of enzyme replacement therapy. With regards to safety, adverse events (i.e., rigors, fever) were more significant in the agalsidase beta as compared to placebo. The long-term influence of enzyme replacement therapy on risk of morbidity and mortality related to Anderson-Fabry disease remains to be established. This review highlights the need for continued research into the use of enzyme replacement therapy for Anderson-Fabry disease.","Nine studies enrolled 351 participants. The studies used different formulations of the enzyme, Agalsidase alfa or beta, and compared them to placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or to each other. Comparison was also made in regard to different dosing schedules. Two studies comparing agalsidase alfa to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma. The combined effects were not significant between the treatment and placebo groups. The study that reported pain and pain-related quality of life showed an improvement for participants receiving treatment over the six-month observation period. Death was not an outcome in either study. One of the three studies comparing agalsidase beta to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide and showed improvement in kidney, heart and composite results. There was no significant difference for death and no studies reported on pain. Only two studies compared agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta. One of them showed no significant difference for any adverse events such as dyspnoea, hypertension and gastrointestinal symptoms - these are not adverse events as gastrointestinal problems are actually a symptom, as may be hypertension in the context of renal disease. Two studies compared different dosing schedules of agalsidase alfa. No differences were found among the schedules for self-assessed health state or for pain scores. In summary, studies comparing enzyme replacement therapy to placebo show significant results in regard to microvascular endothelial deposits of globotriaosylceramide and in pain-related quality of life. There is, however, no evidence identifying if the alfa or beta form is superior, though included trials were small in sample size. With regards to safety, adverse events (i.e., rigors, fever) were more significant with agalsidase beta as compared to placebo. From the information available in most of the study reports, we were not able to clearly judge whether all volunteers had equal chances of being in either of the treatment groups and whether they would have known in advance or during the study which treatment they were receiving."
CD001917,"Eighteen studies were identified by the searches. Only one study could be included which reported results from 17 participants aged 10 to 41 years with an infective exacerbation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All their 31 admissions (18 hospital and 13 at home after two to four days of hospital treatment) were analysed as independent events. Outcomes were measured at 0, 10 and 21 days after initiation of treatment. Home participants underwent fewer investigations than hospital participants (P < 0.002) and general activity was higher in the home group. No significant differences were found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, complications or change of intravenous lines,or time to next admission. Home participants received less low-dose home maintenance antibiotic. Quality of life measures showed no significant differences for dyspnoea and emotional state, but fatigue and mastery were worse for home participants, possibly due to a higher general activity and need of support. Personal, family, sleeping and eating disruptions were less important for home than hospital admissions. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. Indirect costs were not determined. Current evidence is restricted to a single randomized clinical trial. It suggests that, in the short term, home therapy does not harm individuals, entails fewer investigations, reduces social disruptions and can be cost-effective. There were both advantages and disadvantages in terms of quality of life. The decision to attempt home treatment should be based on the individual situation and appropriate local resources. More research is urgently required.","We found one study with 17 people aged 10 to 41 years who had a flare up of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The people taking part were assigned to either home antibiotics or hospital antibiotics at random. Those who had home antibiotics initially spent up to four days in hospital and were taught to prepare and administer their own intravenous antibiotics. They were discharged with enough medication and equipment for the course of treatment and were visited at home. All participants received the same type of antibiotic and the course lasted at least 10 days. There were no differences found for clinical outcomes, adverse events, or complications linked to intravenous treatment. People at home were more tired and found the treatment more difficult to master. This may be due to them being more active and needing more support. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital. There were no details about indirect costs. We conclude that treatment at home does not harm people in the short term and does reduce social disruption. However, the decision in favour of this option must be made on an individual basis. The evidence is very limited and more research is strongly needed to recommend its use."
CD000396,"In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low-back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low-back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects than traditional NSAIDs. The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs in the RCTs included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations.","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are commonly used for treating low-back pain. This review found 65 studies (including over 11,000 patients) of mixed methodological quality that compared various NSAIDs with placebo (an inactive substance that has no treatment value), other drugs, other therapies and with other NSAIDs. The review authors conclude that NSAIDs are slightly effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica (pain and tingling radiating down the leg). In patients with acute sciatica, no difference in effect between NSAIDs and placebo was found. The review authors also found that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs (paracetamol/acetaminophen, narcotic analgesics, and muscle relaxants). Placebo and paracetamol/acetaminophen had fewer side effects than NSAIDs, though the latter has fewer side effects than muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics. The new COX-2 NSAIDs do not seem to be more effective than traditional NSAIDs, but are associated with fewer side effects, particularly stomach ulcers. However, other literature has shown that some COX-2 NSAIDs are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The review noted a number of limitations in the studies. Only 42% of the studies were considered to be of high quality. Many of the studies had small numbers of patients, which limits the ability to detect differences between the NSAID and the control group. There are few data on long term results and long-term side effects."
CD006194,"Fifteen heterogeneous trials, involving 1022 adults with dorsally displaced and potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures, were included. While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation especially in terms of patient characteristics and interventions. Methodological weaknesses among these trials included lack of allocation concealment and inadequate outcome assessment. External fixation maintained reduced fracture positions (redisplacement requiring secondary treatment: 7/356 versus 51/338 (data from 9 trials); relative risk 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.32) and prevented late collapse and malunion compared with plaster cast immobilisation. There was insufficient evidence to confirm a superior overall functional or clinical result for the external fixation group. External fixation was associated with a high number of complications, such as pin-track infection, but many of these were minor. Probably, some complications could have been avoided using a different surgical technique for pin insertion. There was insufficient evidence to establish a difference between the two groups in serious complications such as reflex sympathetic dystropy: 25/384 versus 17/347 (data from 11 trials); relative risk 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 2.32. There is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults. Though there is insufficient evidence to confirm a better functional outcome, external fixation reduces redisplacement, gives improved anatomical results and most of the excess surgically-related complications are minor.","Fifteen trials, involving 1022 adults with potentially or evidently unstable fractures, were included. While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation in their characteristics especially in terms of patient characteristics and the method of external fixation. Weak methodology, such as using inadequate methods of randomisation and outcome assessment, means that the possibility of serious bias can not be excluded. The review found that external fixation reduced fracture redisplacement that prompted further treatment and generally improved final anatomical outcome. It appears to improve function too but this needs to be confirmed. The complications, such a pin tract infection, associated with external fixation were many but were generally minor. Serious complications occurred in both groups. The review concludes that there is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for these fractures."
CD004116,"Seventy-five randomised trials, involving 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome, met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was high, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicines were compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy. Herbal medicines were also combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy alone. Compared with placebo, a Standard Chinese herbal formula, individualised Chinese herbal medicine, STW 5 and STW 5-II, Tibetan herbal medicine Padma Lax, traditional Chinese formula Tongxie Yaofang, and Ayurvedic preparation showed significantly improvement of global symptoms. Compared with conventional therapy in 65 trials testing 51 different herbal medicines, 22 herbal medicines demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for symptom improvement, and 29 herbal medicines were not significantly different than conventional therapy. In nine trials that evaluated herbal medicine combined with conventional therapy, six tested herbal preparations showed additional benefit from the combination therapy compared with conventional monotherapy. No serious adverse events from the herbal medicines were reported. Some herbal medicines may improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. However, positive findings from less rigorous trials should be interpreted with caution due to inadequate methodology, small sample sizes, and lack of confirming data. Some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high-quality trials.","Traditional Chinese herbal medicine is a common practice in the East, and some clinical trials show a benefit of herbal medicines for symptomatic treatment of this condition. This systematic review identified and included 75 randomised clinical trials evaluating the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with irritable bowel syndrome. The review shows that some herbal medicines improve global symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or constipation. However, the methodological quality of the majority of clinical trials evaluating these herbs was generally poor. There is evidence indicating that small, poor quality trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. Although the included trials did not report serious adverse effects from using herbal medicines more research is needed to determine the safety of herbal medicines. In conclusion, herbal medicines might be promising for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. However, it is premature to recommend herbal medicines for routine use in irritable bowel syndrome. Testing the herbs in larger, well-designed trials is needed in order to establish sound evidence for their use."
MR000022,"Ninteen studies were included, reporting on 57 MEDLINE filters and 13 EMBASE filters. Thirty MEDLINE and four EMBASE filters were tested in an evaluation study where the performance of one or more filters was tested against one or more gold standards. The reported outcome measures varied. Some studies reported specificity as well as sensitivity if a reference set containing non-gold standard records in addition to gold standard records was used. In some cases, the original development study did not report any performance data on the filters. Original performance from the development study was not available for 17 filters that were subsequently tested in evaluation studies. All 19 studies reported the sensitivity of the filters that they developed or evaluated, nine studies reported the specificities and 14 studies reported the precision. No filter which had original performance data from its development study, and was subsequently tested in an evaluation study, had what we defined a priori as acceptable sensitivity (> 90%) and precision (> 10%). In studies that developed MEDLINE filters that were evaluated in another study (n = 13), the sensitivity ranged from 55% to 100% (median 86%) and specificity from 73% to 98% (median 95%). Estimates of performance were lower in eight studies that evaluated the same 13 MEDLINE filters, with sensitivities ranging from 14% to 100% (median 73%) and specificities ranging from 15% to 96% (median 81%). Precision ranged from 1.1% to 40% (median 9.5%) in studies that developed MEDLINE filters and from 0.2% to 16.7% (median 4%) in studies that evaluated these filters. A similar range of specificities and precision were reported amongst the evaluation studies for MEDLINE filters without an original performance measure. Sensitivities ranged from 31% to 100% (median 71%), specificity ranged from 13% to 90% (median 55.5%) and precision from 1.0% to 11.0% (median 3.35%). For the EMBASE filters, the original sensitivities reported in two development studies ranged from 74% to 100% (median 90%) for three filters, and precision ranged from 1.2% to 17.6% (median 3.7%). Evaluation studies of these filters had sensitivities from 72% to 97% (median 86%) and precision from 1.2% to 9% (median 3.7%). The performance of EMBASE search filters in development and evaluation studies were more alike than the performance of MEDLINE filters in development and evaluation studies. None of the EMBASE filters in either type of study had a sensitivity above 90% and precision above 10%. None of the current methodological filters designed to identify reports of primary DTA studies in MEDLINE or EMBASE combine sufficiently high sensitivity, required for systematic reviews, with a reasonable degree of precision. This finding supports the current recommendation in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy that the combination of methodological filter search terms with terms for the index test and target condition should not be used as the only approach when conducting formal searches to inform systematic reviews of DTA.","A systematic review of a particular diagnostic test for a disease aims to bring together and assess all the available research evidence. Bibliographic databases are usually searched by combining terms for the disease with terms for the diagnostic test. However, depending on the topic area, the number of articles retrieved by such searches may be very large. Methodological filters consisting of text words and database indexing terms have been developed in the hope of improving the searches by increasing their precision when these filters are added to the search terms for the disease and diagnostic test. On the other hand, using filters to identify records for diagnostic reviews may miss relevant studies while at the same time not making a big difference to the number of studies that have to be assessed for inclusion. This review assessed the performance of 70 filters (reported in 19 studies) for identifying diagnostic studies in the two main bibliographic databases in health, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The results showed that search filters do not perform consistently, and should not be used as the only approach in formal searches to inform systematic reviews of diagnostic studies. None of the filters reached our minimum criteria of a sensitivity greater than 90% and a precision above 10%."
CD009121,"We included 14 studies with a total of 698 participants undergoing thoracotomy. There are two studies awaiting classification. The studies demonstrated high heterogeneity in insertion and use of both regional techniques, reflecting real-world differences in the anaesthesia techniques. Overall, the included studies have a moderate to high potential for bias, lacking details of randomization, group allocation concealment or arrangements to blind participants or outcome assessors. There was low to very low-quality evidence that showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality (2 studies, 125 participants. risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 4.23, P value = 0.68) and major complications (cardiovascular: 2 studies, 114 participants. Hypotension RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.62, P value = 0.45; arrhythmias RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.29, P value = 0.36, myocardial infarction RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.13, 76.42, P value = 0.47); respiratory: 5 studies, 280 participants. RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.52, P value = 0.30). There was moderate-quality evidence that showed comparable analgesic efficacy across all time points both at rest and after coughing or physiotherapy (14 studies, 698 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that showed PVB had a better minor complication profile than TEB including hypotension (8 studies, 445 participants. RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38, P value < 0.0001), nausea and vomiting (6 studies, 345 participants. RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.75, P value = 0.001), pruritis (5 studies, 249 participants. RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.59, P value = 0.0005) and urinary retention (5 studies, 258 participants. RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.46, P value < 0.0001). There was insufficient data in chronic pain (six or 12 months). There was no difference found in and length of hospital stay (3 studies, 124 participants). We found no studies that reported costs. Paravertebral blockade reduced the risks of developing minor complications compared to thoracic epidural blockade. Paravertebral blockade was as effective as thoracic epidural blockade in controlling acute pain. There was a lack of evidence in other outcomes. There was no difference in 30-day mortality, major complications, or length of hospital stay. There was insufficient data on chronic pain and costs. Results from this review should be interpreted with caution due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the lack of reliable evidence. Future studies in this area need well-conducted, adequately-powered RCTs that focus not only on acute pain but also on major complications, chronic pain, length of stay and costs.","We found 14 studies involving 698 participants. Whilst all 14 studies compared broadly the analgesic efficacy of PVB and TEB in participants undergoing open thoracotomy, there were significant differences in the timing, method of insertion and medications used in PVB and TEB. This makes direct comparison difficult. Patient follow-up was limited to the immediate post-surgery period (up to five days post-surgery) with only two studies reporting long-term outcomes such as chronic pain. There are two studies awaiting classification. We found no difference between PVB and TEB in terms of death at 30 days and major complications. PVB appeared to be as effective as TEB in pain control post-surgery. TEB was associated with minor complications such as low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, itching and urinary retention when compared to PVB. We did not find any difference in length of hospital stay between PVB and TEB. There was insufficient information to assess chronic pain and health costs. We found low-quality evidence for death at 30 days, with limited information provided by only two studies reporting this outcome. We only found low to very low-quality evidence for major complications due to lack of information, with only one study reporting these outcomes. We found moderate-quality evidence for acute pain control in the immediate postoperative period. We found moderate-quality evidence for minor complications."
CD004865,"No new trials were identified in March of 2012. Two high quality randomised double-blind controlled studies enrolling 262 infants were identified. A non-significant reduction in the 'Use of one or more RBC transfusions' [two studies 262 infants; typical RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06); typical RD -0.07 (95% CI -0.18 to 0.04; I2 = 0% for both RR and RD] favouring early EPO was noted. Early EPO administration resulted in a non-significant reduction in the ""number of transfusions per infant"" compared with late EPO [typical MD - 0.32 (95% CI -0.92 to 0.29)]. There was no significant reduction in total volume of blood transfused per infant or in the number of donors to whom the infant was exposed. Early EPO led to a significant increase in the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages) [two studies, 191 infants; typical RR 1.40 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.86); typical RD 0.16 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.29); NNTH 6 (95% CI 3 to 33)]. There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I2 = 86% for RR and 81% for RD). Both studies (191 infants) reported on ROP stage > 3. No statistically significant increase in risk was noted [typical RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.41); typical RD 0.05 (-0.04 to 0.14)] There was no heterogeneity for this outcome (0% for both RR and RD). No other important favourable or adverse neonatal outcomes or side effects were reported. The use of early EPO did not significantly reduce the 'Use of one or more RBC transfusions' or the 'Number of transfusions per infant"" compared with late EPO administration. The finding of a statistically significant increased risk of ROP (any grade) and a similar trend for ROP stage > 3 with early EPO treatment is of great concern.","A total of 262 infants born preterm have been enrolled in two studies of early versus late administration of EPO to prevent blood transfusions. There were no demonstrable benefits of early versus late administration of EPO with regards to reduction in the use of red blood cell transfusions, number of transfusions, the amount of red cells transfused or number of donor exposures per infant. However, the use of early EPO compared with late EPO administration increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity, a serious complication in babies born before term. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that either treatment confers any substantial benefits with regard to any donor blood exposure, as many infants enrolled in both studies were exposed to donor blood prior to study entry, and early EPO increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity. Neither early nor late administration of EPO is recommended."
CD004180,"Nine studies met our inclusion criteria, five RCTs, one CCT and three ITSs. Six studies compared telephone consultation versus normal care; four by a doctor, one by a nurse and one by a clinic clerk. Three studies compared telephone consultation by different types of health care workers; two compared nurses with doctors and one compared health assistants with doctors or nurses. Three of five studies found a decrease in visits to GP's but two found a significant increase in return consultations. In general at least 50% of calls were handled by telephone advice alone. Seven studies looked at accident and emergency department visits, six showed no difference between the groups and one, of nurse telephone consultation, found an increase in visits. Two studies reported deaths and found no difference between nurse telephone triage and normal care. Telephone consultation appears to reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by general practitioners. However, questions remain about its affect on service use and further rigorous evaluation is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost and patient satisfaction.","Nine studies were found and analysed to determine whether telephone consultation was safe and effective. In general, at least half of the calls were handled by telephone only (without the need for face-to-face visits). It was found that telephone consultation appears to decrease the number of immediate visits to doctors and does not appear to increase visits to emergency departments. It is still unclear though, whether it is just delaying visits to a later time. Telephone consultation also appears to be safe and people were just as satisfied using the telephone as going to see someone face-to-face. There are still questions about its effectiveness and more research into the use, cost, safety and satisfaction of telephone consultation is needed."
CD012703,"Primary outcomes
Stenting may slightly reduce the number of unplanned return visits (16 trials with 1970 participants; very low CoE), but we are very uncertain of this finding. Pain on the day of surgery as measured on a visual analogue scale (scale 0 to 10; higher values reflect more pain) is probably similar (mean difference (MD) 0.32 higher, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 lower to 0.78 higher; 4 trials with 346 participants; moderate CoE). Pain on postoperative days 1 to 3 may show little to no difference (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.25 higher, 95% CI 0.32 lower to 0.82 higher; 8 trials with 683 participants; low CoE). On postoperative days 4 to 30, stented participants may experience more pain (8 trials with 903 participants; very low CoE), but we are very uncertain of this finding. Stenting may result in little to no difference in the need for secondary interventions (risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.33; 10 studies with 1435 participants; low CoE); this corresponds to three more interventions per 1000 participants (95% CI 13 fewer to 48 more). Secondary outcomes
Stenting may reduce the need for narcotics (7 trials with 830 participants; very low CoE), but we are very uncertain of this finding. Rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) up to 90 days are probably not substantially different (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.51; 10 trials with 1207 participants; moderate CoE); this corresponds to three fewer infections per 1000 participants (95% CI 23 fewer to 29 more). Ureteral stricture rates up to 90 days may be slightly reduced (14 trials with 1625 participants; very low CoE), but we are very uncertain of this finding. Rates of hospital admission may be slightly reduced (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.55; 13 studies with 1647 participants; low CoE). This corresponds to 15 fewer admissions per 1000 participants (95% CI 33 fewer to 27 more). Findings of this review illustrate the trade-offs of risks and benefits faced by urologists and their patients when it comes to decision-making about stent placement after uncomplicated ureteroscopy for stone disease. We noted that both desirable and undesirable effects were small in absolute terms, with findings based mostly on low and very low CoE. The main issues reducing our confidence in research findings were study limitations (mostly risk of performance and detection bias) and imprecision. We were unable to conduct any of the preplanned subgroup analyses, in particular those based on stone size, stone location, and use of ureteral dilation, which may be important effect modifiers. Given the importance of this question, higher-quality and sufficiently large trials are needed to better inform decision-making.","We included 23 trials with 2656 people who either had a stent or not. Whether they received a stent or not was decided by chance. A stent may make people come back to the hospital for problems less often, but we are very uncertain of this finding. Pain on the day of surgery and on days one to three after surgery may be similar. People with a stent may have more pain in the long term (days four to 30), but we are also very uncertain about this. The need for another procedure may be similar. People with a stent may be less likely to need narcotics (strong pain medications that can cause addiction), but we are very uncertain about this. There may be no difference in the risk of a urinary tract infection. Stenting may make people a little less likely to develop a narrowing of the ureter because of scarring and may make them slightly less likely to be admitted to the hospital. However, we are very uncertain of both findings. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate, low, or very low confidence in the study results."
CD004282,"Fifteen trials were included, six of which were added in this update. Three trials of a nursing intervention to manage breathlessness showed benefit in terms of symptom experience, performance status and emotional functioning. Four trials assessed structured nursing programmes and found positive effects on delay in clinical deterioration, dependency and symptom distress, and improvements in emotional functioning and satisfaction with care. Three trials assessed the effect of different psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions in patients with lung cancer. One trial assessing counselling showed benefit for some emotional components of the illness but findings were not conclusive. One trial examined the effects of coaching sensory self monitoring and reporting on pain-related variables and found that although coaching increases the amount of pain data communicated to providers by patients with lung cancer, the magnitude of the effect is small and does not lead to improved efficacy of analgesics prescribed for each patient’s pain level. One trial compared telephone-based sessions of either caregiver-assisted coping skills training (CST) or education/support involving the caregiver and found that patients in both treatment conditions showed improvements in pain, depression, quality of life and self efficacy. Two trials assessed exercise programmes; one found a beneficial effect on self empowerment and the other study showed an increase in quadriceps strength but no significant changes for any measure of quality of life. One trial of nutritional interventions found positive effects for increasing energy intake, but no improvement in quality of life. Two small trials of reflexology showed some positive but short-lasting effects on anxiety and pain intensity. The main limitations of the studies included were the variability of the interventions assessed and the approaches to measuring the considered outcomes, and the lack of data reported in the trials regarding allocation of patients to treatment groups and blinding. Nurse follow-up programmes and interventions to manage breathlessness may produce beneficial effects. Counselling may help patients cope more effectively with emotional symptoms, but the evidence is not conclusive. Other psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions can play some role in improving patients' quality of life. Exercise programmes and nutritional interventions have not shown relevant and lasting improvements of quality of life. Reflexology may have some beneficial effects in the short term.","This review found that nursing programmes and interventions to manage breathlessness may produce beneficial effects and that some psychotherapeutic, psychosocial and educational interventions can play some role in improving the quality of life of patients. Counselling may help patients to cope better with emotional symptoms and reflexology can have some short-term beneficial effects. The main limitations of the included studies were the variability of the interventions, the way results were measured and the lack of 'blinding' (ensuring that those who are measuring the patients' outcomes are not aware of which treatment the patient actually received)."
CD009971,"We identified six eligible studies in total. The six Included studies were generally of high quality, but the largest eligible study was excluded because of concerns about its validity. Study populations were statin naive, which led to a considerable loss of eligible participants. Five RCTs compared statin use with placebo or standard care. We pooled results from three studies, with a total of 178 participants, for mortality and non-fatal event outcomes. In the statin group, 7/105 (6.7%) participants died within 30 days of surgery, as did 10/73 (13.7%) participants in the control group. Only one death in each group was from cardiovascular causes, with an incidence of 0.95% in statin participants and 1.4% in control participants, respectively. All deaths occurred in a single study population, and so effect estimates were derived from one study only. The risk ratio (RR) of all-cause mortality in statin users showed a non-significant decrease in risk (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.75). For cardiovascular death, the risk ratio was 1.05 (95% CI 0.07 to 16.20). Non-fatal MI within 30 days of surgery was reported in three studies and occurred in 4/105 (3.8%) participants in the statin group and 8/73 (11.0%) participants receiving placebo, for a non-significant decrease in risk (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.52). Several studies reported muscle enzyme levels as safety measures, but only three (with a total of 188 participants) reported explicitly on clinical muscle syndromes, with seven events reported and no significant difference found between statin users and controls (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.63). The only participant-reported outcome was nausea in one small study,with no significant difference in risk between groups. Two studies compared different doses of atorvastatin, with a total of 145 participants, but reported data were not sufficient to allow us to determine the effect of higher doses on any outcome. Evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to conclude that statin use resulted in either a reduction or an increase in any of the outcomes examined. The existing body of evidence leaves questions about the benefits of perioperative use of statins for vascular surgery unanswered. Widespread use of statins in the target population means that it may now be difficult for researchers to undertake the large RCTs needed to demonstrate any effect on the incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events. However, participant-reported outcomes have been neglected and warrant further study.","In July 2012 we searched medical databases for controlled trials of participants who had undergone aortic or arterial surgery and were randomly assigned to either statins or placebo (or standard care). Many vascular surgery patients are already taking statins; therefore we also included trials that randomly assigned participants to different doses of statin. Statin treatment should have been started any time between the decision to operate and performance of the operation and continued for at least 48 hours after the operation. We wanted to investigate the effect of this short-term statin therapy on the risk of death and cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke within 30 days of surgery. We also considered adverse effects of statins such as muscle pain. We found five studies that compared participants receiving statins with a control treatment or with placebo, but only three of these reported outcomes could be combined in the meta-analyses. These three studies were of high quality but studied only 178 participants in total. This means that evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to determine whether statins improved patient outcomes after surgery. We were also not able to establish whether any adverse effects such as muscle pain were associated with statin use. We found that two studies had compared different doses of atorvastatin, but evidence was insufficient to determine whether any benefits or risks were associated with using a higher dose. Given the limited quantity of data obtained from randomized controlled trials, further studies are required to allow investigators to gather better information about whether prescribing statins around the time of vascular surgery can improve outcomes. However, widespread use of statins in patients before they need surgery may make these studies impracticable."
CD008190,"We included four trials (70 participants) comparing appetite stimulants (cyproheptadine hydrochloride and megestrol acetate) to placebo; the numbers of adults or children within each trial were not always reported. We assessed the certainty of evidence as low due to the small number of participants, incomplete or selective outcome reporting, and unclear risk of selection bias. Regarding our primary outcomes, a meta-analysis of two trials (42 participants) showed that appetite stimulants may produce a larger increase in weight (kg) at three months (mean difference (MD) 1.25 kg, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.45 to 2.05), and one trial (17 participants) showed a similar result at six months (MD 3.80 kg, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.33) (both low-certainty evidence). Results also showed that weight z score may increase with appetite stimulants compared to placebo at three months (MD 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.93; 3 studies; 40 participants; P < 0.001) and at six months (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.22; 1 trial; 17 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in effect between cyproheptadine hydrochloride and megestrol acetate for either outcome. Only one trial (25 participants) reported analysable data for body composition (BMI), with results favouring cyproheptadine hydrochloride compared to placebo; a further trial (16 participants) narratively agreed with this result. All four trials reported on lung function at durations ranging from two to nine months. Considering analysable data, two trials (42 participants) found that appetite stimulants may make little or no difference in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) % predicted at three months, and one trial (17 participants) found similar results at six months. Two further three-month trials narratively agreed with these results. Limited information was reported for secondary outcomes. Two trials (23 participants) reported results showing that appetite stimulants may increase appetite compared to placebo at three months (odds ratio 45.25, 95% CI 3.57 to 573.33; low-certainty evidence). Only one study reported on quality of life, finding that cyproheptadine reduced fatigue in two participants compared with none with placebo. One study (25 participants) found no difference in energy intake between appetite stimulant or placebo at three months. Insufficient reporting of adverse effects prevented a full determination of their impact. Two studies (33 participants) narratively reported similar requirements for additional antibiotics between appetite stimulants and placebo at three months. At six months in adults and children, appetite stimulants improved only two of the outcomes of this review: weight (or weight z score) and subjectively reported appetite. Insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full determination of their impact. Whilst the data may suggest the potential use of appetite stimulants in treating anorexia in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, this is based upon low-certainty evidence from a small number of trials, therefore firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential adverse effects of appetite stimulants and actively monitor any individuals prescribed these medications accordingly. Research is required to determine meaningful surrogate measures for appetite and to define what constitutes quality weight gain. Future trials of appetite stimulants should use a validated measure of symptoms including a disease-specific instrument for measuring poor appetite. This review highlights the need for multicentred, adequately powered, and well-designed trials to evaluate agents to safely increase appetite in people with cystic fibrosis and to establish the optimal mode of treatment.","We included four trials (70 participants), two of which were performed in children and two in both children and adults. The trials looked at the effects of drugs (megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride) compared to a placebo (a tablet that contained no medicine) to stimulate appetite. The trials lasted between three and six months. We found that these drugs may improve weight and appetite in the short term (up to six months). No effect was seen on lung function. All stimulants can have adverse effects which can worsen cystic fibrosis, such as effects on blood sugar control, fatigue, mood, fluid retention, the liver, and shortness of breath, but unfortunately insufficient reporting of side effects prevented a full understanding of their effects. The included trials were too small to show if megestrol acetate and cyproheptadine hydrochloride can improve weight and appetite safely. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that appetite stimulants may improve weight and poor appetite in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, we believe more research is needed to identify appropriate ways of measuring appetite, and then to collect sound data from enough patients to find out if appetite stimulants can improve appetite safely in cystic fibrosis. We have low confidence in the results being able to show the true effectiveness of appetite stimulants. We came to this conclusion because although we think that most of the people taking part had the same chance of being in the appetite stimulant or placebo group, and no one could not tell the difference between the appetite stimulant or the placebo, there may be some bias due to the small numbers of participants in the studies, and because in two studies some participants withdrew without clear reasons being given. Another possible source of bias is that three studies did not report on all of their pre-planned outcomes."
CD003715,"Twelve studies (2146 participants) that compared 5-ASA to placebo were included. We did not identify any studies that compared sulphasalazine to placebo. Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The other studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias for various items due to insufficient details to allow for a judgement. There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Fifty-three per cent (526/998) of 5-ASA patients (dose 1.6 g to 4 g/day) relapsed at 12 months compared to 54% (544/1016) of placebo patients (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07; 11 studies; 2014 patients; moderate-quality evidence). Sensitivity analyses based on an available case analysis and a random-effects model had no impact on the results. One study found no difference in relapse rates at 24 months. Fifty-four per cent (31/57) of 5-ASA patients (dose 2 g/day) relapsed at 24 months compared to 58% (36/62) of placebo patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.29, 119 patients; low-quality evidence). One paediatric study found no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Sixty-two per cent (29/47) of paediatric 5-ASA patients (dose 50 mg/kg/day) relapsed at 12 months compared to 64% (35/55) of paediatric placebo patients (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.31; 102 patients; moderate-quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event, withdrawal due to adverse events or serious adverse events. Thirty-four per cent (307/900) of 5-ASA patients had at least one adverse event compared to 33% (301/914) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 10 studies; 1814 patients). Fourteen per cent (127/917) of 5-ASA patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 13% (119/916) of placebo patients (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.38; 9 studies; 1833 patients). One per cent (3/293) of 5-ASA patients had a serious adverse event compared to 0.7% (2/283) of placebo patients (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.83; 3 studies; 576 patients). Common adverse events reported in the studies included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash. We found no evidence in this review to suggest that oral 5-ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in patients with Crohn's disease. Additional randomised trials may not be justified.","We found 12 studies that included a total of 2146 participants. Eleven studies including 2014 adult participants compared oral 5-ASA to a placebo (i.e. inactive pills or tablets). One study including 132 children compared oral 5-ASA to a placebo. Eleven studies were conducted for 12 months and one study was conducted for 24 months. Seven studies were judged to be of high quality and the other studies were judged to be of unclear quality because insufficient details were reported to allow for a judgement about quality. The studies with insufficient details were generally older studies that were published 20 or more years ago. A combined analysis of eleven studies including 2014 adult participants found no difference between oral 5-ASA (at daily doses between 1.6 g to 4 g) and placebo in the proportion of participants who remained in remission at 12 months. Similarly, a study including 161 adult participants found no difference between oral 5-ASA (at a dose of 2 g per day) and placebo in the proportion of participants who remained in remission at 24 months. The study involving children found no difference between oral 5-ASA (at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg) and placebo in the proportion of participants who remained in remission at 12 months. There does not appear to be an increased risk of side effects in people who take oral 5-ASA compared to placebo. Common adverse events reported in the studies included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash. In conclusion, there is no evidence that oral 5-ASA is superior to placebo for helping people with Crohn's disease remain in remission that was achieved by medical therapy."
CD000535,"We include 16 studies with 5683 randomised participants. Nine different treatment groups were evaluated: aspirin (ASA) or aspirin and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing (six studies); ASA or ASA/DIP versus pentoxifylline (two studies); ASA/DIP versus indobufen (one study); ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists (two studies); ASA/DIP versus low molecular weight heparin (one study); ticlopidine versus placebo (one study); ASA versus prostaglandin E1 (one study); ASA versus naftidrofuryl (one study); and clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone (one study). The treatment comparisons were evaluated separately, and, where possible, we performed subgroup analysis for venous grafts and prosthetic grafts and at different follow-up time points. The quality of evidence was low to moderate as many of the treatment comparisons had very few studies to contribute data, several of the included studies had unit of analysis issues, the treatment dosages varied between studies, and data for many outcomes important to this review were not given in any of the studies, or differed greatly between studies. Overall study quality was moderate, with the largest problem being that the majority of studies did not describe their methods of randomisation, allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessors, leading to risk ratings of 'unclear'. The other main issue with study quality was studies not blinding participants or personnel. The treatment comparison with the most number of included studies, which allowed for robust conclusions, was that of aspirin (ASA) or ASA and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing, covered by six studies. For this treatment group, there was improved graft patency in the ASA or ASA/DIP treatment group, odds ratio (OR) 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.83; P = 0.01; 952 participants). This effect was not seen for venous grafts alone at any of the time points, but was observed for all time points in prosthetic grafts, including the final time point of 12 months (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.00001; 222 participants). Only a single study evaluated secondary patency, for which there was no difference between treatment groups. For the comparison ASA or ASA/DIP versus placebo or nothing there was no difference for any of the side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, bleeding and wound/graft infection. Amputations, cardiovascular events and mortality were also similar between the treatment groups. The comparison of ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists included two studies, one of which was very large, with over 2000 participants. There were no differences between treatment for primary graft patency at three, six, 12 or 24 months, and there was also no evidence of a difference for limb amputation, cardiovascular events or mortality. One large study (851 participants) evaluated clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone, and for all grafts there was no evidence of a difference of primary patency at 24 months. There was evidence of increased total bleeding in the clopidogrel and ASA group (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.15) from an increase in mild (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.00), and moderate bleeding (OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.37 to 12.45), but no difference in severe or fatal bleeding. There was no difference between the treatment groups for limb amputation or mortality. For the remaining treatment comparisons there is not currently enough evidence to draw any robust conclusions about the efficacy or safety of the treatment on graft patency after peripheral bypass. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or with aspirin plus dipyridamole had a beneficial effect on primary patency of peripheral bypass grafts compared to placebo or no treatment. This effect was not evident when evaluating venous grafts alone, but antiplatelet therapy did have a beneficial effect on patency in those who had prosthetic grafts. There was no evidence of differences in side effects (including general, gastrointestinal, bleeding or infection), amputation, cardiovascular events or mortality between the treatment groups. However, the number of participants included in this analysis might be too small to detect a statistically significant effect for side effects, amputation, cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. We found no difference in primary graft patency when aspirin or aspirin with dipyridamole was compared to a vitamin K antagonist or when clopidogrel with aspirin was compared to aspirin alone. However, there was evidence of increase bleeding in the clopidogrel with aspirin group for the latter comparison. The remaining six treatment comparisons did not include enough data to draw any robust conclusions about their efficacy or safety at this time.","We include 16 studies in this review with 5683 randomised participants. Nine different treatment groups were evaluated: Aspirin (ASA) or aspirin and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing (six studies); ASA or ASA/DIP versus pentoxifylline (two studies); ASA/DIP versus indobufen (one study); ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists (two studies); ASA/DIP versus low molecular weight heparin (one study); ticlopidine versus placebo (one study); ASA versus prostaglandin E1 (one study); ASA versus naftidrofuryl (one study); and clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone (one study). We evaluated the different treatment comparisons separately, and, where possible, we evaluated separately those participants who received different types of grafts, venous or prosthetic. Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence from the review was low to moderate, as there were few studies to provide evidence for the different comparisons; several of the included studies randomised and analysed participants in a way that could introduce bias; and many of the prespecified outcomes of the review were not addressed within the studies, or were reported on in different ways between studies. Also, the treatment dosages varied between studies. Overall study quality was moderate, with the largest problem being that the majority of studies did not described their methods of randomisation or blinding of those that evaluated the outcomes. The other main issue with study quality was not blinding participants or personnel to the treatment received. Key results
The comparison of ASA or ASA and dipyridamole (ASA/DIP) versus placebo or nothing, included the most studies (six), which allowed for robust analysis. For this treatment group, there was improved graft patency in the ASA or ASA/DIP treatment group. There was an improvement in those that received prosthetic grafts, but not in those that received venous grafts. Only a single study evaluated secondary patency, for which there was no difference between treatment groups. For this comparison there was no difference for any of the side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, bleeding and wound/graft infection. Amputations, cardiovascular events and death from any cause were also similar between the treatment groups. The comparison of ASA or ASA/DIP versus vitamin K antagonists included two studies, one of which was very large, with over 2000 participants. There were no differences between treatment for primary graft patency at three, six, 12 or 24 months, and there was also no evidence of a difference for limb amputation, cardiovascular events or mortality. One large study evaluated clopidogrel and ASA versus ASA alone, and for all grafts (including prosthetic and venous grafts) there was no evidence of a difference of primary patency at 24 months. There was evidence of increased total bleeding in the clopidogrel and ASA group, from an increase in mild and moderate bleeding, but there was no difference in severe or fatal bleeding. There was no difference between the treatment groups for limb amputation or death from any cause. For the remaining treatment comparisons there is not currently enough evidence to draw any robust conclusions about the efficacy or safety of the treatment on graft patency after peripheral bypass."
MR000065,"We included 34 studies in our review. Most studies related to HIV vaccine trials. The other studies related to Ebola virus, tuberculosis, Zika virus and COVID-19. We developed 20 key findings, under three broad themes (with seven subthemes), that described the factors that people consider when deciding whether to take part in a vaccine trial for a pandemic or epidemic disease. Our GRADE-CERQual confidence was high in nine of the key findings, moderate in 10 key findings and low in one key finding. The main reason for downgrading review findings were concerns regarding the relevance and adequacy of the underlying data. As a result of the over-representation of HIV studies, our GRADE-CERQual assessment of some findings was downgraded in terms of relevance because the views described may not reflect those of people regarding vaccine trials for other pandemic or epidemic diseases. Adequacy relates to the degree of richness and quantity of data supporting a review finding. Moderate concerns about adequacy resulted in a downgrading of some review findings. Some factors were considered to be under the control of the trial team. These included how trial information was communicated and the inclusion of people in the community to help with trial information dissemination. Aspects of trial design were also considered under control of the trial team and included convenience of participation, provision of financial incentives and access to additional support services for those taking part in the trial. Other factors influencing people's decision to take part could be personal, from family, friends or wider society. From a personal perceptive, people had concerns about vaccine side effects, vaccine efficacy and possible impact on their daily lives (carer responsibilities, work, etc.). People were also influenced by their families, and the impact participation may have on relationships. The fear of stigma from society influenced the decision to take part. Also, from a societal perspective, the level of trust in governments' involvement in research and trial may influence a person's decision. Finally, the perceived rewards, both personal and societal, were influencing factors on the decision to participate. Personal rewards included access to a vaccine, improved health and improved disease knowledge, and a return to normality in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Potential societal rewards included helping the community and contributing to science, often motivated by the memories of family and friends who had died from the disease. This review identifies many of the factors that influence a person's decision to take part in a vaccine trial, and these reflect findings from reviews that examine trials more broadly. However, we also recognise some factors that become more important in connection with a vaccine trial in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. These factors include the potential stigma of taking part, the possible adverse effects of a vaccine, the added motivation for helping society, the role of community leaders in trial dissemination, and the level of trust placed in governments and companies developing vaccines. These specific influences need to be considered by trial teams when designing, and communicating about, vaccine trials in the context of a pandemic or epidemic.","We included 34 studies that looked at people's views and experiences of being invited to take part in a vaccine trial in the context of a pandemic or epidemic. Most of the studies related to HIV vaccine trials. The other studies related to Ebola virus, tuberculosis, Zika virus and COVID-19. Studies were set in many countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The studies looked at the views and experiences of adults aged 18 years and over who had been invited to take part in vaccine clinical trials. Some of them had accepted and some had decided not to take part. We identified several factors that people consider when deciding whether to take part in a vaccine trial during a pandemic or epidemic. We judged our confidence in these findings to be low, moderate or high depending on how well supported that finding was from the included studies. We had moderate to high confidence in most of the findings. Some of the factors that influenced people's decisions were under the control of the team setting up the trial. For instance, people were influenced by how trial information was communicated, and whether community members were involved in information delivery. They were also influenced by how easy or convenient it was to take part in the trial, whether they would be paid to take part and whether they would get access to additional support or health services. Other factors included personal concerns, and the influence of family and friends and wider society. From a personal point of view, people had concerns about vaccine side effects, how well the vaccine works, and how taking part in the trial might impact on their daily lives and responsibilities. People were also influenced by their families and whether taking part might affect their relationships with others. Some people feared stigma from their communities if they took part. People's level of trust in the government's involvement in research and trials could also influence their decisions. People also considered the possible rewards of taking part in a trial and whether these outweighed the risks. Some of these rewards were personal. People wanted to get faster access to a vaccine, improve their health, improve their understanding of the disease and return to normal life during a pandemic or epidemic. But people were also motivated by wanting to help society and contribute to science. This was often tied to memories of family and friends who had died from the disease. We identified 34 studies for this review, but 26 were related to HIV. This raised concerns about the relevance of the data to other diseases. In addition, we had concerns about the quality of the data for some findings. Because of the diversity of the participants in individual studies, we cannot make any inferences by participant types (for example, participants' backgrounds, gender, or social standing or class). This review includes studies published before the end of June 2021."
CD009445,"We included 65 randomised controlled trials from 12 countries involving patients undergoing a variety of procedures in hospitals. Nine thousand and twenty one patients were randomised and entered into these studies. Interventions used various designs and formats but the main data for results were from studies using written materials, audio-visual materials and decision aids. Some interventions were delivered before admission to hospital for the procedure while others were delivered on admission. Only one study attempted to measure the primary outcome, which was informed consent as a unified concept, but this study was at high risk of bias. More commonly, studies measured secondary outcomes which were individual components of informed consent such as knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction with the consent process. Important but less commonly-measured outcomes were deliberation, decisional conflict, uptake of procedures and length of consultation. Meta-analyses showed statistically-significant improvements in knowledge when measured immediately after interventions (SMD 0.53 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.69) I2 73%), shortly afterwards (between 24 hours and 14 days) (SMD 0.68 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.93) I2 85%) and at a later date (15 days or more) (SMD 0.78 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.06) I2 82%). Satisfaction with decision making was also increased (SMD 2.25 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.15) I2 99%) and decisional conflict was reduced (SMD -1.80 (95% CI -3.46 to -0.14) I2 99%). No statistically-significant differences were found for generalised anxiety (SMD -0.11 (95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) I2 82%), anxiety with the consent process (SMD 0.01 (95% CI -0.21 to 0.23) I2 70%) and satisfaction with the consent process (SMD 0.12 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.32) I2 76%). Consultation length was increased in those studies with continuous data (mean increase 1.66 minutes (95% CI 0.82 to 2.50) I2 0%) and in the one study with non-parametric data (control 8.0 minutes versus intervention 11.9 minutes, interquartile range (IQR) of 4 to 11.9 and 7.2 to 15.0 respectively). There were limited data for other outcomes. In general, sensitivity analyses removing studies at high risk of bias made little difference to the overall results. Informed consent is an important ethical and practical part of patient care. We have identified efforts by researchers to investigate interventions which seek to improve information delivery and consideration of information to enhance informed consent. The interventions used consistently improve patient knowledge, an important prerequisite for informed consent. This is encouraging and these measures could be widely employed although we are not able to say with confidence which types of interventions are preferable. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the high levels of heterogeneity associated with many of the main analyses although we believe there is broad evidence of beneficial outcomes for patients with the pragmatic application of interventions. Only one study attempted to measure informed consent as a unified concept.","We searched the scientific literature to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions designed to improve informed consent in clinical practice. We wanted to determine primarily whether these interventions improved all components of ‘informed consent’ (understanding, deliberation and communication of decision). Other individual outcomes of direct relevance to patients (e.g. recall/knowledge, understanding, satisfaction and anxiety), those related to healthcare professionals (e.g. ease of use of intervention, satisfaction) and system outcomes (e.g. cost, rates of procedural uptake) were also assessed. We included 65 studies involving a total of 9021 patients. The studies varied according to the type of intervention, the procedure for which consent was sought, the clinical setting and the outcomes measured. Most interventions were written or audio-visual. Only one study assessed all the elements of informed consent, but the design was not robust; all other studies assessed only components of informed consent. When the results of multiple studies were combined, we found that interventions improved knowledge of the planned procedure, immediately (up to 24 hours), in the short term (1 to 14 days) and the long term (more than 14 days). Satisfaction with decision making was increased; decisional conflict was reduced; and consultation length may be increased. There were no differences between the intervention and control for the outcomes of generalised anxiety, and either anxiety or satisfaction associated with the consent process. Limitations of the review include difficulties combining the results of studies due to variation in the procedures undergone by patients, the interventions used and outcomes measured. This means that we are uncertain as to which specific interventions are most effective but pragmatic steps to improve information delivery and consideration of the information are likely to benefit patients."
CD006459,"We included 32 RCTs with 2844 adult participants. Twenty-six assessed upper-limb and six assessed lower-limb blocks. Seventeen compared ultrasound with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and nine compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulation (US + NS) against PNS alone. Two studies compared ultrasound with anatomical landmark technique, one with a transarterial approach, and three were three-arm designs that included US, US + PNS and PNS. There were variations in the quality of evidence, with a lack of detail in many of the studies to judge whether randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors was sufficient. It was not possible to blind practitioners and there was therefore a high risk of performance bias across all studies, leading us to downgrade the evidence for study limitations using GRADE. There was insufficient detail on the experience and expertise of practitioners and whether experience was equivalent between intervention and control. We performed meta-analysis for our main outcomes. We found that ultrasound guidance produces superior peripheral nerve block success rates, with more blocks being assessed as sufficient for surgery following sensory or motor testing (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR), fixed-effect 2.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.04); 1346 participants), and fewer blocks requiring supplementation or conversion to general anaesthetic (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.28 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.39); 1807 participants) compared with the use of PNS, anatomical landmark techniques or a transarterial approach. We were not concerned by risks of indirectness, imprecision or inconsistency for these outcomes and used GRADE to assess these outcomes as being of moderate quality. Results were similarly advantageous for studies comparing US + PNS with NS alone for the above outcomes (M-H OR, fixed-effect 3.33 (95% CI 2.13 to 5.20); 719 participants, and M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.34 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.56); 712 participants respectively). There were lower incidences of paraesthesia in both the ultrasound comparison groups (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.42 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.76); 471 participants, and M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.97 (95% CI 0.30 to 3.12); 178 participants respectively) and lower incidences of vascular puncture in both groups (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.57); 387 participants, and M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.90); 143 participants). There were fewer studies for these outcomes and we therefore downgraded both for imprecision and paraesthesia for potential publication bias. This gave an overall GRADE assessment of very low and low for these two outcomes respectively. Our analysis showed that it took less time to perform nerve blocks in the ultrasound group (mean difference (MD), IV, fixed-effect -1.06 (95% CI -1.41 to -0.72); 690 participants) but more time to perform the block when ultrasound was combined with a PNS technique (MD, IV, fixed-effect 0.76 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.98); 587 participants). With high levels of unexplained statistical heterogeneity, we graded this outcome as very low quality. We did not combine data for other outcomes as study results had been reported using differing scales or with a combination of mean and median data, but our interpretation of individual study data favoured ultrasound for a reduction in other minor complications and reduction in onset time of block and number of attempts to perform block. There is evidence that peripheral nerve blocks performed by ultrasound guidance alone, or in combination with PNS, are superior in terms of improved sensory and motor block, reduced need for supplementation and fewer minor complications reported. Using ultrasound alone shortens performance time when compared with nerve stimulation, but when used in combination with PNS it increases performance time. We were unable to determine whether these findings reflect the use of ultrasound in experienced hands and it was beyond the scope of this review to consider the learning curve associated with peripheral nerve blocks by ultrasound technique compared with other methods.","The evidence is current up to 27 August 2014. We found 32 studies with 2844 participants. Most studies compared ultrasound with electrical nerve stimulators or compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulators against nerve stimulators alone. We reran the search in May 2015. We will deal with the 11 studies of interest when we next update the review. We combined the results of studies using statistical tests and found that nerve blocks were more likely to be assessed as adequate for surgery and were less likely to need additional anaesthetic when performed using ultrasound guidance or ultrasound guidance combined with other techniques. We also found that there were fewer complications such as 'pins and needles' or accidental punctures of blood vessels. It also took less time to perform the nerve block when ultrasound alone was used. There was variation in the quality of the studies and authors had not always made sufficient attempts to ensure that the outcome assessors were unaware of what technique had been used for the nerve block. Studies had also often not clearly explained how experienced the people giving the nerve block were. This is particularly important, as ultrasound is still a relatively new technique and some anaesthetists may have limited experience. We rated our evidence for whether the nerve blocks were sufficient and adequate for surgery as of moderate quality, but evidence for our other outcomes was either low or very low. Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for peripheral nerve blocks. However, we are unable to say whether this result depends on the experience of the practitioner in the technique being used."
CD012462,"We located two studies (291 participants) for inclusion in this review. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow-up, and nasal decontamination regimens. One study compared mupirocin (2% contained in a base of polyethylene glycol 400 and polyethylene glycol 3350) with a placebo in elective cardiac surgery patients; and one study compared Anerdian (iodine 0.45% to 0.57% (W/V), chlorhexidine acetate 0.09% to 0.11% (W/V)) with no treatment also in cardiac surgery patients. The trials reported limited outcome data on SSI, adverse events and secondary outcomes (e.g. S aureus SSI, mortality). Mupirocin compared with placebo
This study found no clear difference in SSI risk following use of mupirocin compared with placebo (1 trial, 257 participants); risk ratio (RR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 3.25 based on 18/130 events in the mupirocin group and 11/127 in the control group; low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to imprecision). Anerdian compared with no treatment
It is uncertain whether there is a difference in SSI risk following treatment with Anerdian compared with no treatment (1 trial, 34 participants); RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.08 based on 1/18 events in the Anerdian group and 1/16 in the control group; very low certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to imprecision and once due to risk of bias). There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available regarding the clinical effectiveness of nasal decontamination in the prevention of SSI. This limitation is specific to the focused question our review addresses, looking at nasal decontamination as a single intervention in participants undergoing surgery who are known S aureus carriers. We were only able to identify two studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review and one of these was very small and poorly reported. The potential benefits and harms of using decontamination for the prevention of SSI in this group of people remain uncertain.","In September 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving nasal decontamination for preventing SSI. We included two studies with 291 participants, all adults undergoing cardiac surgery. The anti-bacterial products used for cleaning the nose were mupirocin (antibiotic cream) and Anerdian (disinfectant solution). It is unclear whether nasal decontamination makes a difference to the rate of SSI in people carrying S aureus bacteria. S aureus SSI was reported in only one trial and the results do not allow us to be certain about differences in infection rates. Some participants in the Anerdian study reported side effects such as itching around the nose, but these were not serious. Mortality was low where reported (one death was directly related to S aureus infection). The two studies we found did not have many participants and the results were inconclusive. The Anerdian study report did not provide information about how the trial was conducted and this makes it difficult to be sure if it was at risk of bias. The mupirocin study was of better quality and at low risk of bias; but the small number of participants and limited effects affect the quality of the results. Evidence of the potential benefits and harms of using nasal decontamination for the prevention of SSI is currently of low to very low certainty. Larger, better-reported RCTs are needed to assess the clinical effectiveness of this treatment. This plain language summary is up to date as of September 2016."
CD005653,"Twenty-eight trials involving a total of 1742 trial participants were included. First-generation antipsychotics (flupenthixol decanoate, haloperidol, thiothixene); second-generation antipsychotics (aripirazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone), mood stabilisers (carbamazepine, valproate semisodium, lamotrigine, topiramate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, phenelzine sulfate, mianserin), and dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) were tested. First-generation antipsychotics were subject to older trials, whereas recent studies focussed on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. Data were sparse for individual comparisons, indicating marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. The findings were suggestive in supporting the use of second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but require replication, since most effect estimates were based on single studies. The long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed. Adverse event data were scarce, except for olanzapine. There was a possible increase in self-harming behaviour, significant weight gain, sedation and changes in haemogram parameters with olanzapine. A significant decrease in body weight was observed with topiramate treatment. All drugs were well tolerated in terms of attrition. Direct drug comparisons comprised two first-generation antipsychotics (loxapine versus chlorpromazine), first-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (haloperidol versus amitriptyline; haloperidol versus phenelzine sulfate), and second-generation antipsychotic against antidepressant (olanzapine versus fluoxetine). Data indicated better outcomes for phenelzine sulfate but no significant differences in the other comparisons, except olanzapine which showed more weight gain and sedation than fluoxetine. The only trial testing single versus combined drug treatment (olanzapine versus olanzapine plus fluoxetine; fluoxetine versus fluoxetine plus olanzapine) yielded no significant differences in outcomes. The available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. However, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. Antidepressants are not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. Total BPD severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. No promising results are available for the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. Conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the RCT evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).","Available studies tested the effects of antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabiliser treatment in BPD. In addition, the dietary supplement omega-3 fatty acid (commonly derived from fish) which is supposed to have mood stabilising effects was tested. Twenty-eight studies covering 1742 study participants were included. The findings tended to suggest a benefit from using second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but most effect estimates were based on single study effects so repeat studies would be useful. Moreover, the long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed. The small amount of available information for individual comparisons indicated marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. The data also indicated that there may be an increase in self-harming behaviour in patients treated with olanzapine. In general, attention must be paid to adverse effects. Most trials did not provide detailed data of adverse effects and thus could not be considered within this review. We assumed their effects were similar to those experienced by patients with other conditions. Available data of the studies included here suggested adverse effects included weight gain, sedation and change of haemogram parameters with olanzapine treatment, and weight loss with topiramate. Very few beneficial effects were identified for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, they may be helpful in the presence of comorbid problems that are not part of BPD core pathology, but can often be found in BPD patients. There are only few study results per drug comparison, with small numbers of included participants. Thus, current findings of trials and this review are not robust and can easily be changed by future research endeavours. In addition, the studies may not adequately reflect several characteristics of clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods)."
CD009991,"There are no included studies in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned trials that seem never to have started, and one which we excluded a study because it was a report of a case series. This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite growing interest in women’s mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A post hoc PubMed topic (not methodology-specific) search identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial-based evidence upon which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomised studies. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority.","This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis. Unfortunately, no studies were found that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on postnatal psychosis is much needed. Despite a growing interest in women’s mental health, knowledge and research on postnatal psychosis is still very limited. Future well-designed, well-conducted and well-reported studies are necessary to help improve prevention of symptoms and treatment for women with postnatal psychosis.

CD003635,"Three trials with a total of 287 participants operated on for Type I or II TAAA were included. In the first trial of 98 participants, neurological deficits in the lower extremities occurred in 14 (30%) of CSFD group and 17 (33%) controls. The deficit was observed within 24 hours of the operation in 21 (68%), and from three to 22 days in 10 (32%) participants. CSFD did not have a significant benefit in preventing ischaemic injury to the spinal cord. The second trial of 33 participants used a combination of CSFD and intrathecal papaverine. It showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of postoperative neurological deficit (P = 0.039), compared to controls. Analysis was undertaken after only one third of the estimated sample size had entered the trial. In the third trial TAAA repair was performed on 145 participants. CSFD was initiated during the operation and continued for 48 hours after surgery. Paraplegia or paraparesis occurred in 9 of 74 participants (12.2%) in the control group versus 2 of 82 participants (2.7%) receiving CSFD (P = 0.03). Overall, CSFD resulted in an 80% reduction in the relative risk of postoperative deficits. Meta-analysis showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.48 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.92). For CSFD-only trials, OR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.17) and for intention-to-treat analysis in CSFD-only studies, the OR remained unchanged. There are limited data supporting the role of CSFD in thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery for prevention of neurological injury. Further clinical and experimental studies are indicated.","The available evidence does not fully establish CSF drainage as a method of protection. The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature and identified three randomised trials involving a total of 287 participants operated on for high-risk thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. All of the studies used CSF drainage in addition to other measures of spinal cord protection. In the first trial of 98 patients, neurological deficits in the lower extremities occurred in about one third of patients with or without drainage. The deficit was observed within 24 hours of the operation in 21 (68%), and from three to 22 days in 10 (32%). The second trial of 33 patients reported that a combination of CSF drainage and papaverine in the region of the spinal cord (intrathecally) reduced the rate of postoperative neurological deficit compared to controls. In the third trial involving 145 patients, drainage was begun during the operation and continued for 48 hours after surgery. Paraplegia or paraparesis occurred less with CSF drainage (2.7% of patients with drainage versus 12.2% in the control group)."
CD001896,"For the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea there was some evidence of the effectiveness of laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation (LUNA) when compared to a control or no treatment. The comparison between LUNA and laparoscopic presacral neurectomy (LPSN) for primary dysmenorrhoea showed no significant difference in pain relief in the short term; however, long-term LPSN was shown to be significantly more effective than LUNA. For the treatment of secondary dysmenorrhoea six identified RCTs addressed endometriosis and one included women with uterine myomas. The treatment of LUNA combined with surgical treatment of endometrial implants versus surgical treatment of endometriosis alone showed that the addition of LUNA did not aid pain relief. For PSN combined with endometriosis treatment versus endometriosis treatment alone there was an overall difference in pain relief although the data suggests this may be specific to laparoscopy and for midline abdominal pain only. Adverse events were significantly more common for presacral neurectomy; however, the majority were complications such as constipation, which may spontaneously improve. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea, regardless of cause. Future methodologically sound and sufficiently powered RCTs should be undertaken.",The review of trials found there was only limited evidence to support the use of surgery for primary dysmenorrhoea and little evidence for its use in women with endometriosis. No adverse effects were found with UNA but PSN was found to cause treatable constipation. More research is needed.
CD013035,"We identified eight eligible RCTs that included 447 adults with (mostly asymptomatic) PHPT; 223 participants were randomised to parathyroidectomy. Follow-up duration varied from six months to 24 months. Of the 223 participants (37 men) randomised to surgery, 164 were included in the analyses, of whom 163 were cured at six to 24 months (overall cure rate 99%). Parathyroidectomy compared to observation probably results in a large increase in cure rate at six to 24 months follow-up: 163/164 participants (99.4%) in the parathyroidectomy group and 0/169 participants in the observation or medical therapy group were cured of their PHPT (8 studies, 333 participants; moderate certainty). No studies explicitly reported intervention effects on morbidities related to PHPT, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, kidney dysfunction, urolithiasis, cognitive dysfunction or cardiovascular disease, although some studies reported surrogate outcomes for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. A post-hoc analysis revealed that parathyroidectomy, compared to observation or medical therapy, may have little or no effect after one to two years on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) 0.03 g/cm2,95% CI −0.05 to 0.12; 5 studies, 287 participants; very low certainty). Similarly, compared to observation, parathyroidectomy may have little or no effect on femoral neck BMD after one to two years (MD −0.01 g/cm2, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.11; 3 studies, 216 participants; very low certainty). However, the evidence is very uncertain for both BMD outcomes. Furthermore, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on improving left ventricular ejection fraction (MD −2.38%, 95% CI −4.77 to 0.01; 3 studies, 121 participants; very low certainty). Four studies reported serious adverse events. Three of these reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups; consequently, we were unable to include data from these three studies in the pooled analysis. The evidence suggests that parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 78.60; 4 studies, 168 participants; low certainty). Only two studies reported all-cause mortality. One study could not be included in the pooled analysis as zero events were observed in both the intervention and control groups. Parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.20 to 22.60; 2 studies, 133 participants; very low certainty). Three studies measured health-related quality of life using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and reported inconsistent differences in scores for different domains of the questionnaire between parathyroidectomy and observation. Six studies reported hospitalisations for the correction of hypercalcaemia. Two studies reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups and could not be included in the pooled analysis. Parathyroidectomy, compared to observation, may have little or no effect on hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.25; 6 studies, 287 participants; low certainty). There were no reported hospitalisations for renal impairment or pancreatitis. In accordance with the literature, our review findings suggest that parathyroidectomy, compared to simple observation or medical (etidronate) therapy, probably results in a large increase in cure rates of PHPT (with normalisation of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels to laboratory reference values). Parathyroidectomy, compared with observation, may have little or no effect on serious adverse events or hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia, and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on other short-term outcomes, such as BMD, all-cause mortality and quality of life. The high uncertainty of evidence limits the applicability of our findings to clinical practice; indeed, this systematic review provides no new insights with regard to treatment decisions for people with (asymptomatic) PHPT. In addition, the methodological limitations of the included studies, and the characteristics of the study populations (mainly comprising white women with asymptomatic PHPT), warrant caution when extrapolating the results to other populations with PHPT. Large-scale multi-national, multi-ethnic and long-term RCTs are needed to explore the potential short- and long-term benefits of parathyroidectomy compared to non-surgical treatment options with regard to osteoporosis or osteopenia, urolithiasis, hospitalisation for acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease and quality of life.","We wanted to know if parathyroidectomy was better than medical therapy or simple observation for curing mild PHPT with no symptoms and improving disease-associated complications such as osteoporosis, low bone density, kidney stones, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease (conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels) and cognitive dysfunction. We also wanted to determine if parathyroidectomy had any unwanted effects and whether it improved the health-related quality of life of people with PHPT. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined parathyroidectomy compared to non-surgical treatment options in adults with PHPT. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We identified only eight RCTs, which enrolled 433 adults. In total, 164 adults had a parathyroidectomy, and 163 (99%) were cured after six to 24 months. Compared to medical therapy or simple observation, parathyroidectomy probably results in a large increase in cure rates. We have no information on the effect of parathyroidectomy on osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease. However, the included studies reported measures that are closely related to these conditions. Parathyroidectomy may have little or no effect on the bone mineral density of the lower spine and hip after one to two years, but we are very uncertain about the results. The evidence on the effect of parathyroidectomy on left ventricular ejection fraction (the percentage of blood leaving the left heart chamber at each heartbeat) was also very uncertain. Parathyroidectomy, compared to observation, may have little or no effect on unwanted severe events or the occurrence of hospitalisation for the correction of abnormally high calcium levels in the blood. The evidence is very uncertain about the impact of parathyroidectomy on death from any cause. Finally, three RCTs reported results for health-related quality of life. The findings differed widely, and we are uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on health-related quality of life compared to observation. We are moderately confident in the evidence on cure rates because the reports of the RCTs did not contain enough information to prove their methods were reliable. However, we have little or very little confidence in the other results because the methods may have been unreliable, the studies did not measure complications of PHPT directly, and the studies enrolled few people. The evidence is up to date to 26 November 2021."
CD003839,"We identified 28 randomised trials including 8950 participants (newly incorporated in this update: 10 trials including 4227 participants). The overall quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. Pooled estimates showed a reduction in thromboembolic events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; participants = 7594; studies = 18; moderate quality of evidence). Both, trials of self-management or self-monitoring showed reductions in thromboembolic events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70; participants = 3497; studies = 11) and (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.97; participants = 4097; studies = 7), respectively; the quality of evidence for both interventions was moderate. No reduction in all-cause mortality was found (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; participants = 6358; studies = 11; moderate quality of evidence). While self-management caused a reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84; participants = 3058; studies = 8); self-monitoring did not (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15; participants = 3300; studies = 3); the quality of evidence for both interventions was moderate. In 20 trials (8018 participants) self-monitoring or self-management did not reduce major haemorrhage (RR 0.95, 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.12; moderate quality of evidence). There was no significant difference found for minor haemorrhage (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.41; participants = 5365; studies = 13). The quality of evidence was graded as low because of serious risk of bias and substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 82%). Participants who self-monitor or self-manage can improve the quality of their oral anticoagulation therapy. Thromboembolic events were reduced, for both those self-monitoring or self-managing oral anticoagulation therapy. A reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in trials of self-management but not in self-monitoring, with no effects on major haemorrhage.","This is an update of the original review published in 2010. We performed a new search and found 10 new studies (with 4227 participants) to add to the original review, which changed some of the findings. In total, we found 28 randomised trials including 8950 participants that compared self-monitoring and self-management with standard monitoring. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. The combined results of the 28 trials showed a halving of thromboembolic events with self-monitoring and self-management and no reduction in the number of major bleeds. Self-management had similar reductions in thromboembolic events and mortality to the overall benefit, with no effect on major bleeds. Self-monitoring halved the number of major haemorrhages that occurred but did not significantly reduce the rates of thrombotic events or all-cause mortality. In conclusion, self-monitoring or self-management can improve the quality of oral anticoagulant therapy, leading to fewer thromboembolic events and lower mortality, without a reduction in the number of major bleeds. Self-monitoring and self-management are not feasible for all patients, which requires the identification and education of suitable patients."
CD008585,"Five trials involving 187 women with an age range of 15 to 40 years were included. Oral isoxsuprine was compared with placebo in two trials; terbutaline oral spray, ritodrine chloride and oral hydroxyphenyl-orciprenalin were compared with placebo in a further three trials. Clinical diversity in the studies in terms of the interventions being evaluated, assessments at different time points and the use of different assessment tools mitigated against pooling of outcome data across studies in order to provide a summary estimate of effect for any of the comparisons. Only one study, with unclear risk of bias, reported pain relief with a combination of isoxsuprine, acetaminophen and caffeine. None of the other studies reported any significant clinical difference in effectiveness between the intervention and placebo. Adverse effects were reported with all of these medications in up to a quarter of the total number of participants. They included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, quivering, tremor and palpitations. The evidence presented in this review was based on a few relatively small-sized studies that were categorised to have unclear to high risk of bias, which does not allow confident decision-making at present about the use of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for dysmenorrhoea. The benefits as reported in one study should be balanced against the wide array of unacceptable side effects documented with this class of medication. We have emphasised the lack of precision and limitations in the reported data where appropriate.","Five studies involving 187 females with an age range of 15 to 40 years were included in this review. Oral isoxsuprine was examined in two studies; terbutaline oral spray, ritodrine chloride and oral hydroxyphenyl-orciprenalin were compared with placebo in a further three studies. All of the studies were conducted over 30 years ago and none were of high quality. None of these medications, other than isoxsuprine combined with acetaminophen and caffeine, were reported to have any beneficial effect. Side effects with these medications were reported in up to a quarter of the participants and included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, quivering, tremor and palpitations.

CD003611,"One hundred and eighteen studies with 138 treatment groups and 17,364 participants were included in this review. Fifty-seven of these studies were included in the original version of this review while 61 were added, including 27 on interventions that were not considered in the original version. Interventions included amiodarone, beta-blockers, sotalol, magnesium, atrial pacing and posterior pericardiotomy. Each of the studied interventions significantly reduced the rate of post-operative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery compared with a control. Beta-blockers (odds ratio (OR) 0.33; 95% confidence interval) CI 0.26 to 0.43; I2 = 55%) and sotalol (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.43; I2 = 3%) appear to have similar efficacy while magnesium's efficacy (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73; I2 = 51%) may be slightly less. Amiodarone (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.54; I2 = 63%), atrial pacing (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.61; I2 = 50%) and posterior pericardiotomy (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.67; I2 = 66%) were all found to be effective. Prophylactic intervention decreased the hospital length of stay by approximately two-thirds of a day and decreased the cost of hospital treatment by roughly $1250 US. Intervention was also found to reduce the odds of post-operative stroke, though this reduction did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01; I2 = 0%). No significant effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality was demonstrated. Prophylaxis to prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery with any of the studied pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions may be favored because of its reduction in the rate of atrial fibrillation, decrease in the length of stay and cost of hospital treatment and a possible decrease in the rate of stroke. However, this review is limited by the quality of the available data and heterogeneity between the included studies. Selection of appropriate interventions may depend on the individual patient situation and should take into consideration adverse effects and the cost associated with each approach.","Atrial fibrillation after heart surgery is a common complication that has been associated with poor outcomes. We reviewed the literature to better understand the role of preventative interventions for this condition. By combining the results of 118 studies with 17,364 participants, we are able to gain a better understanding of the evidence behind each of these interventions. All of the interventions studied were effective in reducing the occurrence of atrial fibrillation, length of hospital stay, cost of hospital treatment and may be effective in reducing the risk of stroke. The interventions did not have an effect on death after heart surgery. It was not possible to analyze the adverse events associated with the medications studied in this review, but these should be considered by clinicians when choosing an appropriate intervention for their patients. Furthermore, differences in the design between the studies combined in this review may complicate interpretation of these results."
CD010315,"We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) –8.77 mmHg, 95% CI –12.82 to –4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD –4.50 mmHg, 95% CI –6.35 to –2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants). We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.","We wanted to find out if lower blood pressure goals are better than standard blood pressure goals for people with high blood pressure who also have heart or vascular problems. We searched for studies that compared lower blood pressure targets to standard blood pressure targets in people with high blood pressure and a history of cardiovascular disease (heart disease, angina, stroke, vascular disease). Studies had to talk about results such as deaths or other events caused by diseases of the heart or the blood vessels, such as heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. Studies could also talk about other types of health-related side effects. We only chose randomized studies (where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 50 or more people in each group and that lasted at least six months. In this update, we found one new study giving a total of seven studies with 9595 people included in the review. We found little to no difference in total numbers of deaths, or heart or vascular deaths between lower and standard blood pressure goals. There was also little to no difference for the total number of heart or vascular problems and total serious harms, but the evidence was less certain. Based on uncertainty and limited information, we found more people dropped out of the trials because of medicine-related harms in the lower blood pressure target group and no overall health benefit among people in the lower target group. This is the third update of a review first published in 2017. The evidence is up to date to January 2022."
CD007653,"The search identified two randomized controlled trials for inclusion. One trial included 47 hypertensive patients and showed that garlic significantly reduces mean supine systolic blood pressure by 12 mmHg (95% CI 0.56 to 23.44 mmHg, p=0.04) and mean supine diastolic blood pressure by 9 mmHg (95% CI 2.49 to 15.51 mmHg, p=0.007) versus placebo. The authors state that garlic was ""free from side effects"" and that no serious side effects were reported. There were 3 cases ""where a slight smell of garlic was noted."" The second trial could not be meta-analysed as they did not report the number of people randomized to each treatment group. They did report that 200 mg of garlic powder given three times daily, in addition to hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene baseline therapy, produced a mean reduction of systolic blood pressure by 10-11 mmHg and of diastolic blood pressure by 6-8 mmHg versus placebo. Neither trial reported clinical outcomes and insufficient data was provided on adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to determine if garlic provides a therapeutic advantage versus placebo in terms of reducing the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients diagnosed with hypertension. There is also insufficient evidence to determine the difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between patients treated with garlic or placebo. Based on 2 trials in 87 hypertensive patients, it appears that garlic reduces mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 10-12 mmHg and 6-9 mmHg, respectively, over and above the effect of placebo but the confidence intervals for these effect estimates are not precise and this difference in blood pressure reduction falls within the known variability in blood pressure measurements. This makes it difficult to determine the true impact of garlic on lowering blood pressure.","In this analysis, we reviewed the currently available evidence to determine the impact of garlic on cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with hypertension. Based on data from two randomized controlled trials that compared garlic to placebo in patients with hypertension it appears that garlic may have some blood pressure lowering effect, as compared to placebo but the evidence currently available is insufficient to determine whether garlic provides a therapeutic advantage versus placebo in terms of reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Data on the safety of garlic, as a therapeutic entity, in this population is also lacking. More (and large enough) trials comparing several doses of garlic with placebo are needed to detect possible differences in mortality, serious adverse events, and cardiovascular morbidity."
CD012099,"We found no trials comparing one type of support versus another. We included seven RCTs (including one cluster-RCT) involving 831 women. The number of women in each trial ranged from 36 to 226. The trials were conducted in high-income countries: USA (5 trials); Denmark (1 trial) and Australia (1 trial), between 2006 and 2015. Three trials only included women who were obese prior to pregnancy and four trials included both women who were overweight and women who were obese. We judged risk of bias in the included trials to be mixed; only one trial was judged to be low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and attrition bias. Physical breastfeeding support (manual or electric breast pump) versus usual care (no breast pump)
Very low-certainty evidence from one small trial (39 women) looking at a physical support intervention (manual or electric breast pump) versus usual care (no pump) means it is unclear whether physical support improves exclusive breastfeeding at four to six weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 1.51) or any breastfeeding at four to six weeks (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.03). The trial did not report other important outcomes of interest in this review: non-initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive or any breastfeeding at six months postpartum. Multiple methods of breastfeeding support versus usual care
Six trials (involving 792 women) used multiple methods of support including education and social support through telephone or face-to-face contact. One of these trials also provided physical support through providing a breast pump and a baby sling and one trial provided a small gift to the women at each trial visit. Support in the trials was provided by a professional (four trials) or a peer (two trials). One trial provided group support, with the other five trials supporting women individually. One trial (174 women) did not report on any of our main outcomes of interest. We are unclear about the effects of the intervention because we identified very low-certainty evidence for all of the important outcomes in this review: rate of non-initiation of breastfeeding (average RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.11; 3 trials, 380 women); exclusive breastfeeding at four to six weeks (average RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.77; 4 trials, 445 women); any breastfeeding at four to six weeks (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.89; 2 trials, 103 women); rate of exclusive breastfeeding at six months postpartum (RR 7.23, 95% CI 0.38 to 137.08; 1 trial, 120 women); and any breastfeeding at six months postpartum (average RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.87; 2 trials, 223 women). The included trials under the above comparisons also reported on some of this review's secondary outcomes but very low-certainty evidence means that we are unclear about the effects of the intervention on those outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions, or multiple methods of support (social, educational or physical) for supporting the initiation or continuation of breastfeeding in women who are overweight or obese. We found no RCTs comparing one type of support to another type of support. All of our GRADE assessments resulted in very low-certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on limitations in trial design (e.g. risk of attrition bias), imprecision, inconsistency. The available trials were mostly of variable quality with small numbers of participants, confounded by poor adherence within both the intervention and control groups. Well designed, adequately powered research is needed to answer questions about the social, educational, physical support, or any combination of these interventions that could potentially help mothers who are overweight or obese to achieve optimal breastfeeding outcomes. We need trials that examine interventions designed specifically for women who are overweight or obese, delivered by people with training about how to overcome some of the challenges these women face when establishing and maintaining breastfeeding. Particular attention could be given to the assessment of antenatal interventions aimed at improving breastfeeding initiation in women with a raised BMI, and not just focusing on recruiting women who have an intention to breastfeed. Given that the majority of current trials were undertaken in the USA, further trials in a diverse range of countries and settings are required. Future trials need to give consideration to the theoretical basis of the intervention using established frameworks to enable replicability by others and to better determine the components of effective interventions.","We searched for evidence (January 2019) and identified seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 831 women (range 36 to 226 women), conducted in high-income countries (USA, Denmark, Australia) between 2006 and 2015. Three trials only included women who were obese prior to pregnancy and four trials included women who were overweight and women who were obese. The trials compared different types of breastfeeding support to usual care. There were a limited number of trials for each type of support, and differences in how much support the women received in the support and usual care groups. One trial (39 women) used a physical support intervention through the loan of an electric or manual breast pump versus usual care (no pump). Very low-certainty evidence means it is unclear whether physical support improves exclusive breastfeeding at four to six weeks; or any breastfeeding at four to six weeks. The trial did not report other important outcomes of interest: non-initiation of breastfeeding, and exclusive or any breastfeeding at six months after birth. Six trials (792 women) used multiple methods of support (including education and social support through telephone or face-to-face contact) versus usual care.

Support in these trials was provided by a professional (four trials) or a peer (two trials), either in a group (one trial) or individually (five trials). For women receiving an intervention that incorporated multiple methods of support (including social, educational or physical support) versus usual care, we are unclear about the effects of the intervention because we identified very low-certainty evidence for all of the important outcomes in this review: rate of non-initiation of breastfeeding; exclusive breastfeeding at four to six weeks; any breastfeeding at four to six weeks; rate of exclusive breastfeeding at six months after birth; and any breastfeeding at six months after birth. The effectiveness of interventions for supporting women who are overweight or obese to start and continue breastfeeding remains unclear. The methods used by the available trials varied in quality, with small numbers of participants. No trials compared one type of support to another. We need high-quality trials to evaluate whether social, educational, physical support, or any combination of these interventions can give mothers who are overweight or obese the best chance of starting and continuing to breastfeed. The interventions need to be designed specifically for this group of women and delivered by people who understand the challenges these women face when establishing and maintaining breastfeeding."
CD012332,"Our searches identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 292 participants in suitably characterised fibromyalgia. The mean age of participants was between 39 and 50 years, and 89% to 100% were women. The initial pain intensity was around 7/10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale, indicating severe pain. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. The duration of treatment in the double-blind phase varied between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest. Analyses consistently showed no significant difference between NSAID and placebo: substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction) (risk difference (RD) -0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.04) 2 studies, 146 participants; moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction) (RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) 3 studies, 192 participants; withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.09) 4 studies, 230 participants; participants experiencing any adverse event (RD 0.08 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.19) 4 studies, 230 participants; all-cause withdrawals (RD 0.03 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.14) 3 studies, 192 participants. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Although most studies had some measures of health-related quality of life, fibromyalgia impact, or other outcomes, none reported the outcomes beyond saying that there was no or little difference between the treatment groups. We downgraded evidence on all outcomes to very low quality, meaning that this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect could be substantially different is very high. This is based on the small numbers of studies, participants, and events, as well as other deficiencies of reporting study quality allowing possible risks of bias. There is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence about the use of NSAIDs in fibromyalgia, and that comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally be to increase the apparent benefits of NSAIDs, but no such benefits were seen. Consequently, NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for treating fibromyalgia.","We searched for clinical trials in which NSAIDs were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. The latest search was in January 2017. Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, randomising 292 participants to treatment with NSAID or placebo. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. Study duration was between three and eight weeks. Not all studies reported the outcomes of interest. We found no difference between NSAID or placebo for a range of outcomes. Pain reduction by half or better was experienced by 1 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. Pain reduction by a third or better was experienced by about 2 in 10 with both NSAID and placebo. Side effects were experienced by 3 in 10 with NSAID and 2 in 10 with placebo. The evidence was of very low quality. This means that the research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The chance that the real effect of NSAIDs could be substantially different is very high. Small studies like those in this review tend to overestimate results of treatment compared to the effects found in larger, better studies. The very low-quality evidence and the lack of any obvious benefit mean that NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for the management of fibromyalgia."
CD000160,"We included 11 trials involving 2100 participants undergoing 2304 CEA operations. The quality of trials was generally poor. Follow-up varied from hospital discharge to five years. Compared with primary closure, carotid patch angioplasty may make little or no difference to reduction in risk of any stroke during the perioperative period (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.03; P = 0.063; 8 studies, 1769 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may lower the risk of any stroke during long-term follow-up (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.90; P = 0.022; 7 studies, 1332 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In the included studies, carotid patch angioplasty resulted in a lower risk of ipsilateral stroke during the perioperative period (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 7 studies, 1201 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and during long-term follow-up (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1141 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the risk of any stroke or death during long-term follow-up (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; P = 0.003; 6 studies, 1019 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In addition, the included studies suggest that carotid patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41; P < 0.0001; 7 studies, 1435 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce the risk of restenosis during long-term follow-up (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 1719 participants; low-certainty evidence). The studies recorded very few arterial complications, including haemorrhage, infection, cranial nerve palsies and pseudo-aneurysm formation, with either patch or primary closure. We found no correlation between the use of patch angioplasty and the risk of either perioperative or long-term stroke-related death or all-cause death rates. Compared with primary closure, carotid patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of perioperative arterial occlusion and long-term restenosis of the operated artery. It would appear to reduce the risk of ipsilateral stroke during the perioperative and long-term period and reduce the risk of any stroke in the long-term when compared with primary closure. However, the evidence is uncertain due to the limited quality of included trials.","We wanted to find out if people who have people patch angioplasty after carotid endarterectomy – compared with those who have primary closure – have less chance of having a stroke or dying in the short or long term after the operation, or have less chance of their artery narrowing again, without suffering many more complications around the time of the operation. We searched for studies that compared patch angioplasty and primary closure in people who had carotid endarterectomy. We compared and summarised the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and study size. We found 11 studies involving 2100 participants undergoing 2304 carotid endarterectomy operations. The studies were conducted all around the world. Patch angioplasty lowered the risk of stroke in the short and long term after surgery compared with primary closure. Patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of the artery becoming blocked and the risk of the patient having a stroke or dying in the long term. Some studies monitored participants for up to five years, while others stopped monitoring participants after they left hospital. This makes us uncertain about the evidence. The evidence is current to September 2021."
CD001288,"Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate-quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66). FEV1, measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94). There is high-quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.","We found 16 studies including over 1700 people with COPD who experienced a flare-up that required additional medical treatment that compared corticosteroid given by injections or tablets with dummy treatment. Four studies with nearly 300 people compared corticosteroid injections with corticosteroid tablets. More men than women took part in the studies and they were usually in their late 60s, with moderately severe symptoms of COPD. Most studies took place in hospitals, two in intensive care units with people who needed breathing support, and three studies involved people who were treated at home. The last search for studies to include in the review was done in May 2014. There were three studies where people knew which treatment they were getting, but otherwise studies were generally well designed. People treated with either corticosteroid injections or tablets compared with dummy treatment were less likely to experience treatment failure, 122 fewer people per 1000 treated, with a lower rate of relapse by one month. They had shorter stays in hospital if they did not require assisted ventilation in an intensive care unit, and their lung function and breathlessness improved more quickly during treatment. However, they had more adverse events while taking treatment, especially a temporary increase in glucose levels in blood. Corticosteroid treatment did not reduce the number of people who died within one month of their flare-up. In studies comparing two ways of giving corticosteroid, either by injections or tablets, there were no differences in treatment failure, the time in hospital or number of deaths after discharge; however, a temporary increase in glucose levels in blood was more likely with injections than tablets. There is high-quality evidence that is unlikely to be changed by future research that people who experience flare-ups of COPD benefit from treatment with corticosteroid given by injections or tablets with the increased risk of some temporary side effects."
CD002187,"Eight randomised controlled trials were identified. A total 976 men were allocated to receive a PDE-5 inhibitor and 741 were randomised to the control groups. Overall, 80% of the participants suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questions 3 and 4 (frequency of penetration during and maintaining erection to completion of intercourse) was 0.9 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.1) and 1.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.2) at the end of the study period, in favour of the intervention group. The WMD for the IIEF erectile dysfunction domain at the end of the study period was 6.6 (95% CI 5.2 to 7.9) in favour of the PDE-5 inhibitors arm. The relative risk (RR) for answering ""yes"" to a global efficacy question ( ""did the treatment improve your erections?"") was 3.8 (CI 95% 3.1 to 4.5) in the PDE-5 inhibitors compared with the control arm. The WMD between the percentage of successful attempts in the PDE-5 inhibitors and in the control arm was 26.7 (95% CI 23.1 to 30.3). Mortality was not reported in any of the included trials. Adverse cardiovascular effects were reported in one study. Headache was the most frequent adverse event reported, flushing was the second most common event, with upper respiratory tract complaints and flu like syndromes, dyspepsia, myalgia, abnormal vision and back pain also reported in a descending order of frequency. The overall risk ratio for developing any adverse reaction was 4.8 (CI 95% 3.74 to 6.16) in the PDE-5 inhibitors arm as compared to the control. Sufficient evidence exists that PDE-5 inhibitors form a care that improves erectile dysfunction in diabetic men.","In this review we assessed the effect of these agents on erectile dysfunction in diabetic people. Eight studies with 976 men randomised to PDE-5 inhibitor therapy and a duration of mainly 12 weeks were evaluated. Compared to placebo treatment, these agents showed favourable effects in scores estimating sexual life, with an increased rate of adverse effects like headache and flushing after PDE-inhibitor therapy. Mortality was not reported in any of the included trials. Quality of life, with the exception of scores for sexual life, was not relevantly affected. If taken as prescribed, PDE-5 inhibitors comprise a valuable treatment option for erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes."
CD001144,"Seven studies enrolling a total of 669 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. Moderately early steroid treatment (vs placebo or nothing) reduced mortality by 28 days, chronic lung disease at 28 days and 36 weeks, and death or chronic lung disease at 28 days or 36 weeks. Earlier extubation was facilitated. There was no significant effect on the rates of pneumothorax, severe ROP, or NEC. Adverse effects included hypertension, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and infection. Steroid-treated infants were less likely to need late rescue with dexamethasone. There were limited data from four studies of long term follow-up; these did not show evidence of an increase in adverse neurological outcomes. Moderately early corticosteroid therapy (started at 7-14 days) reduces neonatal mortality and CLD, but at the cost of important short term adverse effects. Limited evidence concerning long term effects is provided by the trials included in this review. The methodological quality of the studies determining the long-term outcome is limited in some cases, the children have been assessed predominantly before school age, and no study has been sufficiently powered to detect important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Therefore, given the risk:benefit ratio of short-term effects and the limited long-term follow-up data, it seems appropriate to reserve moderately early corticosteroid treatment to infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of therapy. More research is urgently needed, including long term follow-up of survivors included in previous and any future trials, before the benefits and risks of postnatal steroid treatment, including initiation at 7-14 days, can be reliably assessed (See DART study; Doyle 2000a).","Steroid drugs have been effective in improving lung function but early use is associated with an increase in adverse effects (see Early Review). The review of trials found that moderately early use of corticosteroids (started at 7-14 days) reduces the risk of developing CLD. There is limited evidence about possible long term harmful effects. Short term adverse effects include high blood pressure, infection and an excess of glucose in the blood of these preterm babies. More research is needed. Steroid use should be limited until more information is available."
CD011464,"Four trials involving a total of 300 adults with SMI and PTSD are included. These trials evaluated three active intervention therapies: trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and brief psychoeducation for PTSD, all delivered via individual sessions. Our main outcomes of interest were PTSD symptoms, quality of life/well-being, symptoms of co-morbid psychosis, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, adverse events and health economic outcomes. 1. TF-CBT versus usual care/waiting list
Three trials provided data for this comparison, however, continuous outcome data available were more often found to be skewed than unskewed, leading to the necessity of conducting analyses separately for the two types of continuous data. Using the unskewed data only, results showed no significant differences between TF-CBT and usual care in reducing clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at short term (1 RCT, n =13, MD 13.15, 95% CI -4.09 to 30.39,low-quality evidence). Limited unskewed data showed equivocal results between groups in terms of general quality of life (1 RCT, n = 39, MD -0.60, 95% CI -4.47 to 3.27, low-quality evidence), symptoms of psychosis (1 RCT, n = 9, MD -6.93, 95% CI -34.17 to 20.31, low-quality evidence), and anxiety (1 RCT, n = 9, MD 12.57, 95% CI -5.54 to 30.68, very low-quality evidence), at medium term. The only available data on depression symptoms were skewed and were equivocal across groups at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 48, MD 3.26, 95% CI -3.66 to 10.18, very low-quality evidence). TF-CBT was not associated with more adverse events (1 RCT, n = 100, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.31, low-quality evidence) at medium term. No data were available for health economic outcomes. Very limited data for PTSD and other symptoms were available over the long term. 2. EMDR versus waiting list
One trial provided data for this comparison. Favourable effects were found for EMDR in terms of PTSD symptom severity at medium term but data were skewed (1 RCT, n = 83, MD -12.31, 95% CI -22.72 to -1.90, very low-quality evidence). EMDR was not associated with more adverse events (1 RCT, n = 102, RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.85, low-quality evidence). No data were available for quality of life, symptoms of co-morbid psychosis, depression, anxiety and health economics. 3. TF-CBT versus EMDR
One trial compared TF-CBT with EMDR. PTSD symptom severity, based on skewed data (1 RCT, n = 88, MD -1.69, 95% CI -12.63 to 9.23, very low-quality evidence) was similar between treatment groups. No data were available for the other main outcomes. 4. TF-CBT versus psychoeducation
One trial compared TF-CBT with psychoeducation. Results were equivocal for PTSD symptom severity (1 RCT, n = 52, MD 0.23, 95% CI -14.66 to 15.12, low-quality evidence) and general quality of life (1 RCT, n = 49, MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.95, low-quality evidence) by medium term. No data were available for the other outcomes of interest. Very few trials have investigated TFPIs for individuals with SMI and PTSD. Results from trials of TF-CBT are limited and inconclusive regarding its effectiveness on PTSD, or on psychotic symptoms or other symptoms of psychological distress. Only one trial evaluated EMDR and provided limited preliminary evidence favouring EMDR compared to waiting list. Comparing TF-CBT head-to-head with EMDR and brief psychoeducation respectively, showed no clear effect for either therapy. Both TF-CBT and EMDR do not appear to cause more (or less) adverse effects, compared to waiting list or usual care; these findings however, are mostly based on low to very low-quality evidence. Further larger scale trials are now needed to provide high-quality evidence to confirm or refute these preliminary findings, and to establish which intervention modalities and techniques are associated with improved outcomes, especially in the long term.","We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trial's Register in January 2015 and March 2016 and found four relevant studies involving 300 adults diagnosed with both SMI and PTSD. The participants received treatments that included trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and brief psychoeducation. All of these therapies support individuals to work through and process the memories, emotions and behaviours associated with trauma. Key results
When TF-CBT was compared to the care usually received, no effect for reducing PTSD, psychotic, depressive or anxiety symptoms or improving quality of life, was noted. There was some low-quality evidence from two studies that people with SMI and PTSD receiving TF-CBT were more likely to recover from PTSD, that is, having PTSD symptoms which are below diagnostic threshold. TF-CBT was not linked to an increase in side effects. A comparison of people receiving EMDR against those awaiting treatment showed a favourable effect for reducing the symptoms of PTSD (very low-quality evidence). Again, there was no difference in side effects. No data were available for the effect of EMDR on quality of life, psychosis, depression or anxiety. A comparison of TF-CBT with EMDR indicated no difference in reduction of PTSD symptom severity (very low-quality evidence). Finally, when TF-CBT was compared with brief psychoeducation there was no evidence that either therapy was superior in treating a range of PTSD symptoms. Quality of the evidence
The review identifies limited, low-quality evidence on TF-CBT and EMDR. The effects of these treatments in reducing the symptoms of PTSD remain unclear although they do not appear to cause any more side effects than waiting for treatment. However, many important outcomes of interest have not been reported on and more research into the benefits of trauma-focused psychological interventions for individuals with SMI and PTSD is required."
CD012182,"We included 16 studies with 1750 participants. The studies were 2 to 26 weeks long and compared an oromucosal spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (10 studies), a synthetic cannabinoid mimicking THC (nabilone) (two studies), inhaled herbal cannabis (two studies) and plant-derived THC (dronabinol) (two studies) against placebo (15 studies) and an analgesic (dihydrocodeine) (one study). We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. We defined studies with zero to two unclear or high risks of bias judgements to be high-quality studies, with three to five unclear or high risks of bias to be moderate-quality studies, and with six to eight unclear or high risks of bias to be low-quality studies. Study quality was low in two studies, moderate in 12 studies and high in two studies. Nine studies were at high risk of bias for study size. We rated the quality of the evidence according to GRADE as very low to moderate. Primary outcomes
Cannabis-based medicines may increase the number of people achieving 50% or greater pain relief compared with placebo (21% versus 17%; risk difference (RD) 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.09); NNTB 20 (95% CI 11 to 100); 1001 participants, eight studies, low-quality evidence). We rated the evidence for improvement in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with cannabis to be of very low quality (26% versus 21%;RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17); NNTB 11 (95% CI 6 to 100); 1092 participants, six studies). More participants withdrew from the studies due to adverse events with cannabis-based medicines (10% of participants) than with placebo (5% of participants) (RD 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07); NNTH 25 (95% CI 16 to 50); 1848 participants, 13 studies, moderate-quality evidence). We did not have enough evidence to determine if cannabis-based medicines increase the frequency of serious adverse events compared with placebo (RD 0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.03); 1876 participants, 13 studies, low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes
Cannabis-based medicines probably increase the number of people achieving pain relief of 30% or greater compared with placebo (39% versus 33%; RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.15); NNTB 11 (95% CI 7 to 33); 1586 participants, 10 studies, moderate quality evidence). Cannabis-based medicines may increase nervous system adverse events compared with placebo (61% versus 29%; RD 0.38 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.58); NNTH 3 (95% CI 2 to 6); 1304 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence). Psychiatric disorders occurred in 17% of participants using cannabis-based medicines and in 5% using placebo (RD 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15); NNTH 10 (95% CI 7 to 16); 1314 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence). We found no information about long-term risks in the studies analysed. Subgroup analyses
We are uncertain whether herbal cannabis reduces mean pain intensity (very low-quality evidence). Herbal cannabis and placebo did not differ in tolerability (very low-quality evidence). The potential benefits of cannabis-based medicine (herbal cannabis, plant-derived or synthetic THC, THC/CBD oromucosal spray) in chronic neuropathic pain might be outweighed by their potential harms. The quality of evidence for pain relief outcomes reflects the exclusion of participants with a history of substance abuse and other significant comorbidities from the studies, together with their small sample sizes.","Study characteristics
In November 2017 we searched for clinical trials that used cannabis products to treat conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults. We found 16 studies involving 1750 people. Studies lasted 2 to 26 weeks. Studies compared different cannabis-based medicines. Ten studies compared an oromucosal (mouth) spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Two studies each compared inhaled herbal cannabis and cannabis plant-derived THC with placebo, and one study compared a man-made cannabinoid mimicking the effects of THC (nabilone) with placebo. One study compared nabilone with a pain killer (dihydrocodeine). We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. There was no high-quality evidence. All cannabis-based medicines pooled together were better than placebo for the outcomes substantial and moderate pain relief and global improvement. All cannabis-based medicines pooled together were better than placebo in reducing pain intensity, sleep problems and psychological distress (very low- to moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference between all cannabis-based medicines pooled together and placebo in improving health-related quality of life, stopping the medication because it was not effective, and in the frequency of serious side effects (low-quality evidence). More people reported sleepiness, dizziness and mental problems (e.g. confusion) with all cannabis-based medicines pooled together than with placebo (low-quality evidence). There was moderate-quality evidence that more people dropped out due to side effects with cannabis-based medicines than with placebo. Herbal cannabis was not different from placebo in reducing pain and the number of people who dropped out due to side effects (very low-quality evidence)."
CD000205,"The review now includes four trials (total 75 people, one additional trial since 2006, 21 people) randomising inpatients and outpatients in China and the USA. Risk of bias was mostly unclear as reporting was poor. We are uncertain about all the effects as all evidence was graded at very low quality. We found no significant difference between benzodiazepines and placebo for the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in TD' (2 RCTs, 32 people, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.09, very low quality evidence). Significantly fewer participants allocated to clonazepam compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) experienced no clinically important improvement (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). For the outcome 'deterioration of TD symptoms,' we found no clear difference between benzodiazepines and placebo (2 RCTs, 30 people, RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 9.82, very low quality evidence). All 10 participants allocated to benzodiazepines experienced any adverse event compared with 7/11 allocated to phenobarbital (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.41, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the incidence of participants leaving the study early for benzodiazepines compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 56 people, RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 48.04, very low quality evidence) or compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) (no events, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, which are outcomes designated important by patients. No trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or treatment as usual reported on adverse effects. There is only evidence of very low quality from a few small and poorly reported trials on the effect of benzodiazepines as an adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic-induced TD. These inconclusive results mean routine clinical use is not indicated and these treatments remain experimental. New and better trials are indicated in this under-researched area; however, as benzodiazepines are addictive, we feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are chosen.","The review includes four clinical trials with 75 people who had tardive dyskinesia as a result of using antipsychotic medicines. The participants were randomised into groups that received either their usual antipsychotic medicine plus a benzodiazepine or their usual antipsychotic plus a placebo (dummy medicine). Improvement in TD symptoms was similar between the treatment groups. Participants were just as likely to leave the studies early from the placebo groups as the benzodiazepine groups. Data were not available for outcomes important to patients such as improvement in social confidence, social inclusion, social networks or quality of life. Evidence is limited because the trials are so few, small, and poorly reported. It is uncertain whether benzodiazepines are helpful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The use of benzodiazepines for treating people with antipsychotic-induced TD therefore remains experimental, and because they are highly addictive, a last resort. The low number of studies in this review strongly indicates that this is not an active area of research. To fully investigate whether benzodiazepines have any positive effects for people with tardive dyskinesia, there would have to be more well-designed, conducted and reported trials. This plain language summary was adapted by the review authors from a summary originally written by Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (mcpin.org/)."
CD010266,"A total of 11 trials were included in this review. Most of the studies had an unclear risk of bias prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for our outcomes. Seven of these trials provided evidence for the main comparison and the primary outcome and these were pooled. Overall, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of SSI (plausible effects range between a 76% to a 0.26% relative reduction in SSI with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis) (472 participants; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.74; moderate-quality evidence). There is uncertainty surrounding the relative effects of short-term antibiotics compared with a single dose (220 participants; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.22; low-quality evidence). No reports described adverse effects associated with the drugs in those trials that reported in this outcome. None of these trials assessed or reported data regarding other outcomes, and information was insufficient to show whether a specific antibiotic is better than another. For people undergoing orthognathic surgery, long term antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of SSI compared with short-term antibiotic prophylaxis and the is uncertainty of whether short-term antibiotic prophylaxis decreases SSi risk relative to a single pre-operative dose of prophylactic antibiotics.","We conducted a comprehensive search for studies on this topic. We collected data from all studies addressing this question and summarised them to determine whether antibiotics could prevent infection after surgery, whether this treatment has any adverse effects, whether it reduces the number of days that patients need to be in the hospital and whether it improves overall health status. We found 11 studies. Overall, long-term antibiotics reduce the risk of SSI, and there is uncertainty regarding the effects of receiving one dose of antibiotics preoperatively versus short term antibiotics. There was no investigation of side effects of antibiotics in these studies, but in the studies where side effects were investigated, no side effects were found. None of the other effects of interest to clinicians or patients were measured in the studies, and information was insufficient to show whether any single antibiotic is better than any other."
CD015332,"We included 4 studies providing data for 300 participants (average age 21.94 years). The mean sample size was 75 participants (range 61 to 90 participants). Study duration was between 26 and 39 weeks for the intervention period and 26 to 104 weeks for the follow-up period. Three studies employed a blind rater, while one study was triple-blind. All analyses included data from a maximum of three studies. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. For the primary outcome overall symptoms of schizophrenia, results showed a difference favouring CBT without antipsychotics when compared to no specific treatment at long term (> 1 year mean difference measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS MD) −14.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) −27.75 to −1.79, 1 RCT, n = 34). There was no difference between CBT without antipsychotics compared with antipsychotics (up to 12 months PANSS MD 3.38, 95% CI −2.38 to 9.14, 2 RCTs, n = 63) (very low-certainty evidence) or compared with CBT in combination with antipsychotics (up to 12 months standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.30, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.65, 3 RCTs, n = 125). Compared with no specific treatment, CBT without antipsychotics was associated with a reduction in overall symptoms (as described above) and negative symptoms (PANSS negative MD −4.06, 95% CI −7.50 to −0.62, 1 RCT, n = 34) at longer than 12 months. It was also associated with a lower duration of hospital stay (number of days in hospital MD −22.45, 95% CI −28.82 to −16.08, 1 RCT, n = 74) and better functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale MD −12.42, 95% CI −22.75 to −2.09, 1 RCT, n = 40, low-certainty evidence) at up to 12 months. We did not find a difference between CBT and antipsychotics in any of the investigated outcomes, with the exception of adverse events measured with the Antipsychotic Non-Neurological Side-Effects Rating Scale (ANNSERS) at both 6 and 12 months (MD −4.94, 95% CI −8.60 to −1.28, 2 RCTs, n = 48; MD −6.96, 95% CI −11.55 to −2.37, 2 RCTs, n = 42). CBT without antipsychotics was less effective than CBT combined with antipsychotics in reducing positive symptoms at up to 12 months (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76, 3 RCTs, n = 126). CBT without antipsychotics was associated with a lower number of participants experiencing at least one adverse event in comparison with CBT combined with antipsychotics at up to 12 months (risk ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.80, 1 RCT, n = 39, low-certainty evidence). This review is the first attempt to systematically synthesise the evidence about CBT delivered without medication to people with schizophrenia. The limited number of studies and low to very low certainty of the evidence prevented any strong conclusions. An important limitation in the available studies was that participants in the CBT without medication group (about 35% on average) received antipsychotic treatment, highlighting the challenges of this approach. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to provide additional data on the feasibility and efficacy of CBT without antipsychotics.","We wanted to find out if CBT is effective and safe when used without medication for people with schizophrenia. We searched for studies that examined CBT given without antipsychotics compared with no specific treatment, antipsychotics, or CBT plus antipsychotics. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 4 studies that involved 300 participants with schizophrenia. Study duration was between 26 and 39 weeks for the intervention period, and participants were contacted again to collect further data between 26 and 104 weeks. The included studies were conducted in the UK and Australia, and were all sponsored by public institutions. We found that compared to no specific treatment, CBT without antipsychotics may result in a reduction in overall symptoms (at least in the long term) and negative symptoms (e.g. apathy, loss of interest and motivation, lack of concentration). It may also result in better functioning and lower duration of hospital stay in comparison with no specific treatment. CBT without antipsychotics may not differ from CBT plus antipsychotics in modifying overall symptoms of schizophrenia. CBT without antipsychotics may be less effective than CBT plus antipsychotics in reducing positive symptoms specifically (e.g. hearing voices), and may result in fewer adverse effects compared to CBT plus antipsychotics. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low, meaning that we have limited to very little confidence in the results. This is because study participants and therapists were aware of the treatment being received, which could have influenced the results. In addition, it was often the case that during the study participants received treatment with antipsychotics when this was not planned. Furthermore, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the numbers of included studies and study participants were too small to be certain about the results. The evidence is current to March 2022."
CD004054,"We included 10 RCTs, of which 5 were new to this update; all interventions were adjuncts to conventional therapy and were delivered in primary- and secondary-care settings. There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational interventions and 44 participants in the 1 psychological study. Some included studies had methodological weaknesses; for example, we judged four studies to have high risk of detection bias, attrition bias, or other bias. Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis)), and improvement in sleep and quality of life. No study reported participant-rated global assessment or improvement of sleep. The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention groups. It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group education sessions. Statistically significant improvements in objective severity using the SCORAD clinical tool were recorded for all intervention groups when compared with controls. Improvements in objective severity (intervention minus no intervention) by age group were as follows: age 3 months to 7 years = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.8; age 8 to 12 years = 6.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 11.2; and age 13 to 18 years = 9.9, 95% CI 4.3 to 15.5. In three of five studies, which could not be combined because of their heterogeneity, the objective SCORAD measure was statistically significantly better in the intervention group compared with the usual care groups. However, in all of the above studies, the confidence interval limits do not exceed the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD. The largest study measured quality of life using the German 'Quality of life in parents of children with atopic dermatitis' questionnaire, a validated tool with five subscales. Parents of children under seven years had significantly better improvements in the intervention group on all five subscales. Parents of children aged 8 to 12 years experienced significantly better improvements in the intervention group on 3 of the 5 subscales. This update has incorporated five new RCTs using educational interventions as an adjunct to conventional treatment for children with atopic eczema. We did not identify any further studies using psychological interventions. The inclusion of new studies has not substantially altered the conclusions from the original review. The educational studies in both the original review and this update lack detail about intervention design and do not use a complex interventions framework. Few use an explicit theoretical base, and the components of each intervention are not sufficiently well described to allow replication. A relative lack of rigorously designed trials provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of educational and psychological interventions in helping to manage the condition of atopic eczema in children. However, there is some evidence from included paediatric studies using different educational intervention delivery models (multiprofessional eczema interventions and nurse-led clinics) that these may lead to improvements in disease severity and quality of life. Educational and psychological interventions require further development using a complex interventions framework. Comparative evaluation is needed to examine their impact on eczema severity, quality of life, psychological distress, and cost-effectiveness. There is also a need for comparison of educational interventions with stand-alone psychosocial self-help.","The main finding of this review is that there is currently only limited research evidence about the effect of educational and psychological approaches when used alongside medicines for the treatment of childhood eczema. Included studies provided a range of interventions, from a single 15-minute consultation to a comprehensive series of sessions delivered to groups of parents over a period of 12 hours. Details of the interventions used and the educational theory base are generally poorly described. Outcome measures varied between studies. Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions from this review, several studies using educational interventions demonstrated improvements in eczema severity and quality of life for both children and families. In particular, two studies showed promise. One large study (n = 992) using a multi-disciplinary group education intervention in a hospital setting showed modest improvements in disease severity and quality of life. The single study using psychological approaches indicated that relaxation methods reduced the severity of eczema when compared to discussion only. There is a need for further research into this subject, and priority should be given to comparing the relative cost effectiveness of health professionals educating parents either in teams or by nurses alone. There is also a need for comparison with stand-alone self-help. The most appropriate timeframe for evaluating the effect of interventions should be considered."
CD003748,"We included 16 double-blind, RCTs (3972 participants) comparing cilostazol with placebo, of which five studies also compared cilostazol with pentoxifylline. Treatment duration ranged from six to 26 weeks. All participants had intermittent claudication secondary to PAD. Cilostazol dose ranged from 100 mg to 300 mg; pentoxifylline dose ranged from 800 mg to 1200 mg. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded by one level for all studies because publication bias was strongly suspected. Other reasons for downgrading were imprecision, inconsistency and selective reporting. Cilostazol versus placebo
Participants taking cilostazol had a higher ICD compared with those taking placebo (MD 26.49 metres; 95% CI 18.93 to 34.05; 1722 participants; six studies; low-certainty evidence). We reported QoL measures descriptively due to insufficient statistical detail within the studies to combine the results; there was a possible indication in improvement of QoL in the cilostazol treatment groups (low-certainty evidence). Participants taking cilostazol had a higher ACD compared with those taking placebo (39.57 metres; 95% CI 21.80 to 57.33; 2360 participants; eight studies; very-low certainty evidence). The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, diarrhoea, abnormal stools, dizziness, pain and palpitations. Participants taking cilostazol had an increased odds of experiencing headache compared to participants taking placebo (OR 2.83; 95% CI 2.26 to 3.55; 2584 participants; eight studies; moderate-certainty evidence).Very few studies reported on other outcomes so conclusions on revascularisation, amputation, or cardiovascular events could not be made. Cilostazol versus pentoxifylline
There was no difference detected between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance, both in terms of ICD (MD 20.0 metres, 95% CI -2.57 to 42.57; 417 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence); and ACD (MD 13.4 metres, 95% CI -43.50 to 70.36; 866 participants; two studies; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported on QoL; the study authors reported no difference in QoL between the treatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on revascularisation, amputation or cardiovascular events. Cilostazol participants had an increased odds of experiencing headache compared with participants taking pentoxifylline at 24 weeks (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.17; 982 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). Cilostazol has been shown to improve walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. However, participants taking cilostazol had higher odds of experiencing headache. There is insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of cilostazol for serious events such as amputation, revascularisation, and cardiovascular events. Despite the importance of QoL to patients, meta-analysis could not be undertaken because of differences in measures used and reporting. Very limited data indicated no difference between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance and data were too limited for any conclusions on other outcomes.","We included 16 double-blind, randomised controlled trials, with 3972 adults (search up to 9 November 2020). Participants taking cilostazol for three to six months could walk approximately 26 metres further before calf pain and 40 metres further in total compared to participants taking placebo. However, participants taking cilostazol had nearly three times the odds of experiencing headache related to study medication. There is currently not enough information about the effectiveness of cilostazol for serious events such as amputation, revascularisation and cardiovascular events. Despite its importance, only four studies reported quality of life, using different tools and ways of reporting. Very limited data indicated no difference between cilostazol and pentoxifylline for improving walking distance, and there was not enough information comparing cilostazol with pentoxifylline, for any other outcomes. We judged the evidence to be 'very low' to 'low-certainty' for all outcomes except headaches, which were 'moderate-certainty'. All studies were downgraded because we strongly suspected publication bias from drug company involvement. Cilostazol can increase the distance walked both in total and before the onset of pain, compared to placebo. Cilostazol was associated with increased headaches and there was a lack of evidence for other important outcomes such as amputation, revascularisation and cardiovascular events."
CD009515,"Three of the five included studies compared milrinone versus levosimendan, one study compared milrinone with placebo, and one compared milrinone verus dobutamine, with 101, 242, and 50 participants, respectively. Three trials were at low risk of bias while two were at higher risk of bias. The number and definitions of outcomes were non-uniform as well. In one study comparing two doses of milrinone and placebo, there was some evidence in an overall comparison of milrinone versus placebo that milrinone lowered risk for LCOS (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.96; 227 participants). The results from two small studies do not provide enough information to determine whether milrinone increases the risk of LCOS when compared to levosimendan (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.65; 59 participants). Mortality rates in the studies were low, and there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effect of milrinone compared to placebo or levosimendan or dobutamine regarding mortality, the duration of intensive care stay, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, or maximum inotrope score (where available). Numbers of patients requiring mechanical cardiac support were also low and did not allow a comparison between studies, and none of the participants of any study received a heart transplantation up to the end of the respective follow-up period. Time to death within three months was not reported in any of the included studies. A number of adverse events was examined, but differences between the treatment groups could not be proven for hypotension, intraventricular haemorrhage, hypokalaemia, bronchospasm, elevated serum levels of liver enzymes, or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% or reduced left ventricular fraction of shortening < 28%. Our analysis did not prove an increased risk of arrhythmias in patients treated prophylactically with milrinone compared with placebo (RR 3.59, 95% CI 0.83 to 15.42; 238 participants), a decreased risk of pleural effusions (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.42; 231 participants), or a difference in risk of thrombocytopenia on milrinone compared with placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.88; 238 participants). Comparisons of milrinone with levosimendan or with dobutamine, respectively, did not clarify the risk of arrhythmia and were not possible for pleural effusions or thrombocytopenia. There is insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of prophylactic milrinone in preventing death or low cardiac output syndrome in children undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, compared to placebo. So far, no differences have been shown between milrinone and other inodilators, such as levosimendan or dobutamine, in the immediate postoperative period, in reducing the risk of LCOS or death. The existing data on the prophylactic use of milrinone has to be viewed cautiously due to the small number of small trials and their risk of bias.","Study characteristics: We found five studies, and we asked the study authors for more information. Three studies compared milrinone versus levosimendan, one study compared milrinone versus placebo, and one compared milrinone versus dobutamine. The patients were given the study drugs for 24 to 48 hours and were watched for six to 78 days. A total of 393 participants were included. Quality of evidence: Thus, the data are from a limited number of small trials and therefore must be viewed with caution. In addition, it was not always clear that the patient groups were formed and treated in a way that would make them completely comparable, that patients stayed in the trial for complete assessment, or that all study results were reported conscientiously. Key results: In one study comparing two doses of milrinone and placebo, milrinone was better than placebo to prevent reduced heart function within 36 hours after surgery, but there was not enough information about long-term heart function beyond the first postoperative days. It was not shown whether milrinone was better than placebo or than any of the other medications to prevent death, or whether the intensive care unit stay or hospital stay or time on mechanical ventilation was shorter if patients received milrinone. Similarly, when examining the studies regarding side effects of milrinone, we could not prove that milrinone caused more heart rhythm disturbances than dobutamine or placebo, or how it affected heart rhythm compared with levosimendan. We could not generate other useful information from comparing the trials regarding other harms which had been previously ascribed to milrinone, such as high heart rate, low blood pressure, bleeding into the brain's ventricular fluid, low potassium level in the blood, narrowing of the airways, low numbers of platelets in the blood, altered liver function tests, or low measurements of heart function by ultrasound. This was in part due to the different trial designs."
CD013334,"We included 61 parallel-arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high-income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight-reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low-carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low (≤ 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low-carbohydrate, balanced-fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high-protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes. Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight-reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) −1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.55 to −0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD −0.93 kg, 95% CI −1.81 to −0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one year (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.31, I2 = 17%, 137 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). In overweight and obese participants with T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to six months (MD −1.26 kg, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.09, I2 = 47%, 1114 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD −0.33 kg, 95% CI −2.13 to 1.46, I2 = 10%, 813 participants, 7 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well in change in DBP, HbA1c and LDL cholesterol over 1 to 2 years. The evidence is very uncertain about whether there is a difference in the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5% at one to two years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, I2 = 0%, 106 participants, 2 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on participant-reported adverse effects was limited, and we could not draw any conclusions about these. There is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomised to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets.","We wanted to find out if low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets were better for weight loss and heart disease risk factors than balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. We wanted to find this out for people with and without type 2 diabetes. We searched six electronic databases and trial registries for all trials* that compared low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets with balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. The trials had to last for at least three months. We compared and summarised the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. *A trial is a type of study in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. We found 61 trials involving 6925 people who were overweight or living with obesity. The biggest trial was in 419 people and the smallest was in 20 people. All except one of the trials were conducted in high-income countries worldwide, and nearly half were undertaken in the USA (26). Most trials (36) were undertaken in people who did not have heart disease or risk factors. Most people (5118 people) did not have type 2 diabetes. The average starting weight of people across the trials was 95 kg. Most studies (37) lasted for six months or less; and the longest studies (6) lasted for two years. Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in weight loss over the short term (trials lasting 3 to 8.5 months) and long term (trials lasting one to two years) compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets, in people with and without type 2 diabetes. In the short term, the average difference in weight loss was about 1 kg and in the long term, the average difference was less than 1 kg. People lost weight on both diets in some trials. The amount of weight lost on average varied greatly with both diets across the trials from less than 1 kg in some trials and up to about 12 kg in others in the short term and long term. Similarly, low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets probably result in little to no difference in diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and LDL cholesterol (‘unhealthy’ cholesterol) for up to two years. We could not draw any conclusions about unwanted effects reported by participants because very few trials reported these. We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some the trials were conducted, which included that many trials did not report all their results. Further research may change these results. The evidence is up-to-date to June 2021."
CD010697,"We included eight trials (709 participants); seven were from middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America where zinc deficiency is likely to be a public health problem. Four trials compared the effect of zinc-fortified staple foods with unfortified foods (comparison 1), and four compared zinc-fortified staple foods in combination with other nutrients/factors with the same foods containing other nutrients or factors without zinc (comparison 2). The interventions lasted between one and nine months. We categorised most trials as having unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, but low risk of bias for blinding and attrition. None of the studies in comparison 1 reported data on zinc deficiency. Foods fortified with zinc increased the serum or plasma zinc levels in comparison to foods without added zinc (mean difference (MD) 2.12 µmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.00 µmol/L; 3 studies; 158 participants; low-quality evidence). Participants consuming foods fortified with zinc versus participants consuming the same food without zinc had similar risk of underweight (average risk ratio 3.10, 95% CI 0.52 to 18.38; 2 studies; 397 participants; low-quality evidence) and stunting (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.13; 2 studies; 397 participants; low-quality evidence). A single trial of addition of zinc to iron in wheat flour did not find a reduction in proportion of zinc deficiency (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.94; very low-quality evidence). We did not find a difference in serum or plasma zinc levels in participants consuming foods fortified with zinc plus other micronutrients when compared with participants consuming the same foods with micronutrients but no added zinc (MD 0.03 µmol/L, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.72 µmol/L; 4 studies; 250 participants; low-quality evidence). No trial in comparison 2 provided information about underweight or stunting. There was no reported adverse effect of fortification of foods with zinc on indicators of iron or copper status. Fortification of foods with zinc may improve the serum zinc status of populations if zinc is the only micronutrient used for fortification. If zinc is added to food in combination with other micronutrients, it may make little or no difference to the serum zinc status. Effects of fortification of foods with zinc on other outcomes including zinc deficiency, children’s growth, cognition, work capacity of adults, or on haematological indicators are unknown. Given the small number of trials and participants in each trial, further investigation of these outcomes is required.","We included eight trials (709 participants); seven were from middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America where zinc deficiency is likely to be a public health problem. The effect of fortification of foods with zinc on incidence of zinc deficiency is uncertain. Fortification of foods with zinc may slightly improve the blood zinc levels of populations if zinc is the only micronutrient used for fortification. Zinc added to food in combination with other micronutrients may make little or no difference to blood zinc levels. The fortification of foods with zinc may make little or no difference on incidence of underweight or stunting. The effects of fortification of foods with zinc on other outcomes, including wasting and weight/height, are unknown. Fortification of foods with zinc does not seem to have any adverse effect on indicators of iron or copper status. Most studies included in this review involved a small number of participants and were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias. There were also some inconsistencies in the results across different studies."
CD008207,"Eleven RCTs involving 808 participants met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included studies was variable and most of the predefined outcomes were reported by only one or two studies, therefore the quality of the evidence was low. Five studies with a total of 405 patients reported the incidence of DVT. In the CPM group (205 patients) 36 developed DVT (18%) compared to 29 (15%) in the control group (200 patients). The results of the meta-analysis showed no evidence that CPM had any effect on preventing VTE after TKA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.79). One trial (150 participants) did not find PE in any of the patients during hospitalisation or in the subsequent three months. PE was not reported in the other included studies. None of the trials reported deaths among the included participants. There is not enough evidence from the available RCTs to conclude that CPM reduces VTE after TKA. We cannot assess the effect of CPM on mortality because no such events occurred amongst the participants of these trials. The quality of the evidence was low. The results are supported by only a small number of studies, most of which are of low to moderate quality.","We included 11 trials involving 808 participants in our review. The methodological quality of the included studies was variable and the quality of the evidence was low because the outcomes of interest were only reported by one or two studies. Sensitive methods such as venography or sonography were not always used to diagnose DVT and the CPM was applied differently across studies, varying in range of motion, duration of CPM per day and the number of days after the surgery. The incidence of DVT or VTE was not clearly different in the CPM group compared with the control group of participants. This review did not find enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to conclude that CPM reduces VTE."
CD014201,"Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on-demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens
For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low-certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice-weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once-a-week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low-certainty evidence). Transient low-titer anti-FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood-transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low-certainty evidence). Comparison of prophylactic and on-demand regimens
Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on-demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on-demand treatment, MD -30.34 (95% CI -46.95 to -13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low-certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long-term effects of prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on-demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD -17.20 (95% CI -27.48 to -6.92 (moderate-certainty evidence). Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate-certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood-transmitted infections were identified. Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect. There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on-demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously-treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI. When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons. Well-designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost-effective treatment regimens.","This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on-demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results."
CD006638,"In this updated review, one new ongoing study was found but no new eligible completed studies were identified. This update was therefore conducted using the same four studies included in the original review. These studies included a total of 1219 participants, mean age 40 to 54 years. All included studies were reported as RCTs. Two were multicentred, together including a total of 1114 patients who underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping, and were judged to have an overall low risk of bias. The other two studies were single centred. One included 80 patients who had a craniotomy following severe traumatic brain injury and was judged to have an unclear or low risk of bias. The other study included 25 patients who underwent hemicranicectomy to relieve oedema following cerebral infarction and was judged to have an unclear or high risk of bias. All studies assessed hypothermia versus normothermia. Overall 608 participants received hypothermia with target temperatures ranging from 32.5 °C to 35 °C, and 611 were assigned to normothermia with the actual temperatures recorded in this group ranging form 36.5 °C to 38 °C. For those who were cooled, 556 had cooling commenced immediately after induction of anaesthesia that was continued until the surgical objective of aneurysm clipping was achieved, and 52 had cooling commenced immediately after surgery and continued for 48 to 96 hours. Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for the outcomes mortality during treatment or follow-up (ranging from in-hospital to one year); neurological outcome measured in terms of the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) of 3 or less; and adverse events of infections, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and congestive cardiac failure. With regards to mortality, the risk of dying if allocated to hypothermia compared to normothermia was not statistically significantly different (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.27, P = 0.47). There was no indication that the time at which cooling was started affected the risk of dying (RR with intraoperative cooling 0.95, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.51, P = 0.83; RR for cooling postoperatively 0.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35, P = 0.26). For the neurological outcome, the risk of having a poor outcome with a GOS of 3 or less was not statistically different in those who received hypothermia versus normothermia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.04, P = 0.09). Again there was no indication that the time at which cooling was started affected this result. Regarding adverse events, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence in those allocated to hypothermia versus normothermia for risk of surgical infection (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.97, P = 0.48), myocardial infarction (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.98, P = 0.22), ischaemic stroke (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05, P = 0.24) or congestive heart failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.21, P = 0.38). In contrast to other outcomes, where time of application of cooling did not change the statistical significance of the effect estimates, there was a weak statistically significant increased risk of infection in those who were cooled postoperatively versus those who were not cooled (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.98, P = 0.03). Overall, as in the original review, no evidence was found that the use of induced hypothermia was either beneficial or harmful in patients undergoing neurosurgery. We found no evidence that the use of induced hypothermia was associated with a significant reduction in mortality or severe neurological disability, or an increase in harm in patients undergoing neurosurgery.","Studies in animals have shown that lowering the body temperature can help to protect the brain cells in circumstances when the blood supply to the cells is compromised. Similarly, studies in humans who have been resuscitated after their heart stopped beating have shown that lowering their body temperature helps to reduce brain damage. The purpose of this updated version of a previous review of the same title was to determine whether cooling patients who were having brain surgery reduced death and serious disability, or was associated with increased risk of harm. A detailed search of the available literature up until May 2014 identified four eligible studies that included a total of 1219 participants. Their results were combined to answer these questions. No evidence was found that cooling patients who are having brain operations reduced the risk of death or severe disability, or produced significant harm."
CD011076,"Two RCTs were included, involving 2667 adult patients with RRMS to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dosages of dimethyl fumarate (240 mg orally three times daily or twice daily) by direct comparison with placebo for two years. Among them, a subsample of 1221 (45.8%) patients were selected to participate in MRI evaluations by each study site with MRI capabilities itself. No powered head-to-head study with an active treatment comparator has been found. Meta-analyses showed that dimethyl fumarate both three times daily and twice daily reduced the number of patients with a relapse (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.66, P < 0.00001 and 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77, P < 0.00001, respectively) or disability worsening (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87, P = 0.0009 and 0.65, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81, P = 0.0001, respectively) over two years, compared to placebo. The treatment effects were decreased in the likely-case scenario analyses taking the effect of dropouts into consideration. Both dosages also reduced the annualised relapse rate. Data of active lesions on MRI scans were not combined because there was a high risk of selection bias for MRI outcomes and imprecision of MRI data in both studies, as well as an obvious heterogeneity between the studies. In terms of safety profile, both dosages increased the risk for adverse events and the risk for drug discontinuation due to adverse events. The most common adverse events included flushing and gastrointestinal events (upper abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhoea). Uncommon adverse events included lymphopenia and leukopenia, but they were more likely to happen with dimethyl fumarate than with placebo (high dosage: RR 5.25, 95% CI 2.20 to 12.51, P = 0.0002 and 5.23, 95% CI 2.47 to 11.07, P < 0.0001, respectively; low dosage: RR 5.69, 95% CI 2.40 to 13.46, P < 0.0001 and 6.53, 95% CI 3.13 to 13.64, P < 0.00001, respectively). Both studies had a high attrition bias resulting from the unbalanced reasons for dropouts among groups. Quality of evidence for relapse outcome was moderate, but for disability worsening was low. There is moderate-quality evidence to support that dimethyl fumarate at a dose of 240 mg orally three times daily or twice daily reduces both the number of patients with a relapse and the annualised relapse rate over two years of treatment in comparison with placebo. However, the quality of the evidence to support the benefit in reducing the number of patients with disability worsening is low. There is no high-quality data available to evaluate the benefit on MRI outcomes. The common adverse effects such as flushing and gastrointestinal events are mild-to-moderate for most patients. Lymphopenia and leukopenia are uncommon adverse events but significantly associated with dimethyl fumarate. Both dosages of dimethyl fumarate have similar benefit and safety profile, which supports the option of low-dose administration. New studies of high quality and long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate the benefit of dimethyl fumarate on prevention of disability worsening and to observe the long-term adverse effects including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.","We searched medical databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to dimethyl fumarate or a control drug (randomised controlled trials). The efficacy of this therapy was considered in terms of occurrence of relapses and progression of the disease. We found moderate quality evidence that both dosages of dimethyl fumarate reduce the number of people with RRMS having relapse after two years of treatment, while there is low quality evidence showing that the medicine reduces the number of people who experience worsening disability at the end of two years. Common adverse effects such as flushing and gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea, nausea and upper abdominal pain) are mild to moderate for most of patients. Dimethyl fumarate can have an effect on the body's immune system by causing a drop in the number of the white blood cells which help to fight infection. More people in the groups treated with dimethyl fumarate experienced this than they did with placebo. We found moderate quality that people were more likely to leave the study early because of adverse events if they were treated with dimethyl fumarate than with placebo."
MR000025,"We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies had unclear risk of bias and two had high risk of bias. The results of these RCTs were not consistent; two demonstrated no differences between blinded and unblinded assessments, two found that blinded assessments had significantly lower quality scores, and another observed significantly higher quality scores for blinded assessments. The remaining study did not report the level of significance. We pooled five studies reporting sufficient information in a meta-analysis. We observed no statistically significant difference in risk of bias assessments between blinded or unblinded assessments (standardized mean difference -0.13, 95% confidence interval -0.42 to 0.16). The mean difference might be slightly inaccurate, as we did not adjust for clustering in our meta-analysis. We observed inconsistency of results visually and noted statistical heterogeneity. Our review highlights that discordance exists between studies examining blinded versus unblinded risk of bias assessments at the systematic review level. The best approach to risk of bias assessment remains unclear, however, given the increased time and resources required to conceal reports effectively, it may not be necessary for risk of bias assessments to be conducted under blinded conditions in a systematic review.","When researchers want to answer a question they can use an approach called a systematic review, which is intended to examine all of the studies that have been done in a particular area of interest. When examining and summarizing the literature, researchers are expected to determine which of the studies were well-conducted (i.e. high quality) and those that were not. What we do not know enough about is how researchers should conduct the assessments to determine which studies were of high quality. This is important because if the researcher is aware of certain study characteristics (e.g. what journal the study was published in) they may inadvertently assess the study a certain way. For example, if the author of the study is well-known to the assessor, they may be more likely to assume it is of 'high quality'. Our research examines whether blinding researchers to study characteristics makes a difference when the goal is to summarize the literature. We only found a few studies that reported data relevant to our question. The results from these studies were inconsistent, however, the results suggest that it may not make a difference if quality is appraised under blinded or unblinded conditions during a systematic review."
CD003915,"Fourteen eligible trials, which recruited patients between 1974 and 2005, were identified, eight of which compared 'more' with 'less' chemotherapy. Results from these eight trials, including 1519 patients, showed that treatment consisting of 'more' chemotherapy was associated with longer overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.77 to 0.96; P = 0.005) and with longer progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 1526; HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; P < 0.0001). However, serious acute toxicities were more common in women randomised to the more-intense chemotherapy regimens. There was no evidence to suggest that any particular doublet chemotherapy was better (or worse) than any other, or that any single-agent chemotherapy was better (or worse) than another; however, data for these two comparisons were limited. There were no comparative trials of chemotherapy with endocrine therapy or best supportive care alone. This review suggests that more-intense chemotherapy regimens may improve both OS and PFS for women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, owing to inconsistencies between cytotoxic drug combinations that have been assessed in randomised trials to date, the optimum regimen has still to be defined. Future trials should aim to include measures of quality of life (QoL) and symptom control in addition to survival and progression outcomes.","Using more chemotherapy drugs in combination seems to help women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer to live for longer and to delay the cancer from spreading or getting worse. However, giving these extra drugs may cause more serious short-term side effects. We do not know what effect using more drugs has on long-term side effects, control of symptoms or quality of life because they were poorly studied in the individual trials included in this review."
CD010750,"We identified 24,704 citations from our database search. Nine trials with 379 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Participants had cerebral palsy (CP) in five of the studies and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in the other four. Participants across the trials ranged in age from 2 to 19 years. All studies, apart from one cross-over trial, were parallel designed RCTs. Three of the trials on CP evaluated intrathecal baclofen (ITB) and two botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A). All of the OI trials evaluated the use of bisphosphonates (two alendronate and one pamidronate). No trials were identified that evaluated a commonly used analgesic in this patient group. Pain was a secondary outcome in five of the eight identified studies. Overall the quality of the trials was mixed. Only one study involved over 100 participants. For the two ITB studies for pain in CP, in the same study population but assessed at different time points in their disease, both found an effect on pain favouring the intervention compared to the control group (standard care or placebo) (mean difference (MD) 4.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15 to 6.25; MD 26.60, 95% CI 2.61 to 50.59, respectively). In these studies most of the adverse events related to the procedure or device for administration rather than the drug, such as swelling at the pump site. In one trial there were also eight serious adverse effects; these included difficulty swallowing and an epileptic seizure. The trial did not state if these occurred in the intervention group. At follow-up in both BoNT-A trials there was no evidence of a difference in pain between the trial arms among CP participants. The adverse events in the BoNT-A trials mostly involved those who received the intervention drug and involved seizures. Gastrointestinal problems were the most frequent adverse event in those who received alendronate. The trial investigating pamidronate found no evidence of a difference in pain compared to the control group. No adverse events were reported in this trial. Published, controlled evidence on the pharmacological interventions for pain in CYP with LLCs is limited. The evidence that is currently available evaluated pain largely as a secondary outcome and the drugs used were all adjuvants and not always commonly used in general paediatric palliative care for pain. Based on current data this systematic review is unable to determine the effects of pharmacological interventions for pain for CYP with LLCs. Future trials with larger populations should examine the effects of the drugs commonly used as analgesics; with the rising prevalence of many LLCs this becomes more necessary.","Overall, these trials did not find clear evidence of a benefit of the drugs tested in the treatment of pain. This was apart from the two on cerebral palsy where pain relief occurred with the use of baclofen delivered via a catheter into the spinal cord. However the procedure to deliver this medication resulted in most side effect reported in these trials; this was swelling at the site of the catheter, and in one study it reported that this occurred in around half of the children (8/17). Five children also leaked spinal fluid from the catheter resulting in headache and nausea and, for two children, a prolonged hospital stay. The trials were limited by the quality of their methods and most did not set out to measure the benefit of the drug in reducing pain as a main focus. In conclusion, the evidence on pain treatment in children and young people with life-limiting health conditions is very limited, and only evaluated in participants with certain diseases and not for drug treatments primarily used to treat pain. The trials that were identified evaluated the drugs in small samples of children. There remains a need for more research to help guide doctors in their decisions on how to treat pain in these children and young people."
CD005159,"Five trials with a total of 924 participants met the inclusion criteria; 5% of participants were HIV positive. Only one small trial was methodologically adequate. The two largest trials (818 participants) had unclear allocation concealment and included < 90% of randomized participants in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in between the regimens for cure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 553 participants, 2 trials) or relapse (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.35; 448 participants, 2 trials). The number of adverse events was not significantly different (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.31; 714 participants, 3 trials), though the RR increased with rifabutin dose: 150 mg (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.12; 264 participants, 2 trials); and 300 mg (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.34; 450 participants, 2 trials). However, lack of dose adjustment by weight in the relevant trials complicates interpretation of this relationship. The replacement of rifampicin by rifabutin for first-line treatment of tuberculosis is not supported by the current evidence. HIV-positive people with tuberculosis, the group most likely to benefit from the rifabutin use, are under-represented in trials to date, and further trials in this group would be useful.","This review identified five trials involving 924 people, but none were of high quality. The review found no significant differences between rifabutin- and rifampicin-containing treatment in curing tuberculosis and preventing relapse, but higher doses of rifabutin might be associated with more adverse effects and there was no evidence that it could shorten treatment. However, very few people with HIV and tuberculosis, who are most likely to benefit from use of rifabutin due to its lack of interaction with antiretroviral drugs, were included in the trials. Better quality clinical trials are needed to understand the place of rifabutin in the treatment of people with tuberculosis, particularly those who also have HIV."
CD011483,"We included two RCTs involving 72 participants. Sixty-nine participants were included in one meta-analysis (balance). Both trials assessed QoL, along with secondary outcomes measures relating to movement and psychological outcomes; one also measured disability. In one study the Stroke Impact Scale was used to measure QoL across six domains, at baseline and post-intervention. The effect of yoga on five domains (physical, emotion, communication, social participation, stroke recovery) was not significant; however, the effect of yoga on the memory domain was significant (mean difference (MD) 15.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 29.31, P = 0.03), the evidence for this finding was very low grade. In the second study, QoL was assessed using the Stroke-Specifc QoL Scale; no significant effect was found. Secondary outcomes included movement, strength and endurance, and psychological variables, pain, and disability. Balance was measured in both studies using the Berg Balance Scale; the effect of intervention was not significant (MD 2.38, 95% CI -1.41 to 6.17, P = 0.22). Sensititivy analysis did not alter the direction of effect. One study measured balance self-efficacy, using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (MD 10.60, 95% CI -7.08,= to 28.28, P = 0.24); the effect of intervention was not significant; the evidence for this finding was very low grade. One study measured gait using the Comfortable Speed Gait Test (MD 1.32, 95% CI -1.35 to 3.99, P = 0.33), and motor function using the Motor Assessment Scale (MD -4.00, 95% CI -12.42 to 4.42, P = 0.35); no significant effect was found based on very low-grade evidence. One study measured disability using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) but reported only whether participants were independent or dependent. No significant effect was found: (odds ratio (OR) 2.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 8.60, P = 0.31); the evidence for this finding was very low grade. Anxiety and depression were measured in one study. Three measures were used: the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GCDS15), and two forms of State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Form Y) to measure state anxiety (i.e. anxiety experienced in response to stressful situations) and trait anxiety (i.e. anxiety associated with chronic psychological disorders). No significant effect was found for depression (GDS15, MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.70 to 0.50, P = 0.11) or for trait anxiety (STAI-Y2, MD -6.70, 95% CI -15.35 to 1.95, P = 0.13), based on very low-grade evidence. However, a significant effect was found for state anxiety: STAI-Y1 (MD -8.40, 95% CI -16.74 to -0.06, P = 0.05); the evidence for this finding was very low grade. No adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence
We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of trials included in the review both of which were judged to be at high risk of bias, particularly in relation to incompleteness of data and selective reporting, and especially regarding the representative nature of the sample in one study. Yoga has the potential for being included as part of patient-centred stroke rehabilitation. However, this review has identified insufficient information to confirm or refute the effectiveness or safety of yoga as a stroke rehabilitation treatment. Further large-scale methodologically robust trials are required to establish the effectiveness of yoga as a stroke rehabilitation treatment.","We found two research studies that had assessed yoga for stroke survivors. Seventy-two people took part in the two studies. One study was in the USA and one was in Australia. On average, the stroke survivors were between 60 and 63 years old and it had been between four years three months and nine years since they had had a stroke. In the American study, yoga classes were held twice a week for eight weeks. In the Australian study, yoga classes were held once a week for 10 weeks. Both studies encouraged people to practice yoga at home, in their own time. Both studies used waiting-list control groups. This means that people in the control group could go to yoga classes at the end of the study. The American study was funded by the US Government. The Austrailian study was funded by the National Stroke Foundation (Australia). We were able to analyse study data from 69 participants. No significant benefit was found on measures of QoL, balance, strength, endurance, pain, disability scores. No significant benefit was found on measures of movement, although one study reported a significant benefit in improving aspects of range of movement. One study reported a significant benefit in reducing anxiety. Neither study reported on measures of patient harm. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of trials included in the review, both of which we judged to be at high risk of bias, particularly in relation to incompleteness of data and selective reporting, and especially regarding the representative nature of the sample in one study. The review could not identify enough high-quality evidence on the benefits and safety of yoga in stroke rehabilitation. More good-quality research studies are needed to be sure that yoga has benefits for stroke survivors."
CD005332,"Two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, with data from four short-term RCTs (169 participants) available for analysis. Response data from a single placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine suggested overall superiority of medication relative to placebo (relative risk (RR) 3.07, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.72, n = 67). Symptom severity was also significantly reduced in the RCTs of fluoxetine and clomipramine (relative to desipramine), as well as in the two CBT trials (WMD -44.96, 95% CI -54.43 to -35.49, n = 73). A low relapse rate (4/22) was demonstrated in one trial of CBT. Results from the small number of available RCTs suggest that SRIs and CBT may be useful in treating patients with BDD. The findings of these studies need to be replicated. In addition, future controlled studies in other samples, such as adolescents, and using other selective SRIs, as well as a range of psychological therapy approaches and modalities (alone and in combination), are essential in supplementing the sparse data currently available.","Our systematic review of randomised controlled trials assesses the effects of drug treatment or psychotherapy when used on their own or in combination. We found five eligible trials, including three of psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP)) and two of medication (the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) fluoxetine and clomipramine). In the only placebo-controlled medication trial included in our review, people with BDD treated with fluoxetine were more likely to respond (56%, 19 out of 34) than those allocated placebo (18%, 6 out of 33). Symptoms became less severe after treatment with both medication and psychotherapy. Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and none of the people in the active treatment groups were reported to have dropped out of the studies because of treatment-emergent adverse events. There is preliminary evidence from one trial of CBT that the effects of CBT may persist once treatment has ended. Treatment response in the medication trials was not effected by the degree to which people had insight into their condition. Although few controlled trials have been done, and those that have been conducted were small, indicating that our findings should be used with caution unless confirmed by larger studies (some of which are ongoing), the results suggest that treatment with both medication or psychotherapy can be effective in treating the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder."
CD004635,"Three randomised controlled trials (with 165 women) were included. The live birth rate per woman was significantly higher in women receiving the GnRH agonist compared to the control group (OR 9.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 78.22). However, this was based on one trial reporting ""viable pregnancy"" only. The clinical pregnancy rate per woman was also significantly higher (three studies: OR 4.28, 95% CI 2.00 to 9.15). The information on miscarriage rates came from two trials with high heterogeneity and, therefore, results of the meta-analysis were doubtful. The included studies provided insufficient data to investigate the effects of administration of GnRH agonists on multiple or ectopic pregnancies, fetal abnormalities or other complications. The administration of GnRH agonists for a period of three to six months prior to IVF or ICSI in women with endometriosis increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by fourfold. Data regarding adverse effects of this therapy on the mother or fetus are not available at present.","Endometriosis is a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue (the lining of the womb) outside the cavity of the womb. Many women with the disease suffer from menstrual pain and some suffer from infertility. Infertile women with endometriosis are often treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) but have a lower chance of becoming pregnant compared to women who are infertile with blocked tubes. It has been suggested that giving GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI could increase the chances of pregnancy. We have reviewed the literature and found that treating women for three to six months with GnRH agonists before IVF or ICSI increases the odds of clinical pregnancy four-fold. However, at present there is no information on the effect of this treatment on the incidence of ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancies or complications arising for the women or their offspring."
CD003720,"Completed randomised trials were not found. There is one trial that is currently ongoing in Italy; the results have yet to be published. Two prospective observational studies had data on recurrence-free survival. One study reported an odds ratio for recurrence rate at one year (where > 1 favours the luteal phase) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.08); 0.87 at two years (95% CI 0.69 to 1.09); 0.95 at three years (95% CI 0.75 to 1.21); 1.12 at four years (95% CI 0.87 to 1.43); and 1.12 at five years (95% CI 0.87 to 1.43). Another study reported a hazard ratio for overall survival of 1.02 (95% CI 0.995 to 1.04, P = 0.14) and for disease-free survival of 1.00 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.02, P = 0.92) at three years based on the last and first menstrual period. The results were not significant. There was no difference in the recurrence rate whether the surgery was done during the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In the absence of RCTs, this review provides evidence from large prospective observational studies that timing of surgery does not show a significant effect on survival.","Of the three prospective observational studies, one reported no survival differences between menstrual cycle groups after stratification by lymph node status at a mean follow-up of 48 months. The results showed a lack of prognostic value (recurrence-free survival and overall survival) of timing of surgery in relation to the menstrual period or to oestrogen and progesterone levels in premenopausal breast carcinoma patients. One study gave no data on mean survival time or recurrence-free survival and the third study reported no significant difference in the overall survival of patients when surgery was done in either the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. A large randomised controlled trial would be ideal to establish the influence of timing of surgery in relation to the menstrual cycle (follicular phase or luteal phase) on the prognosis of breast cancer. However, in the absence of this, the information available from the prospective observational studies shows that there is no difference in disease-free survival and overall survival in non-metastatic breast cancer patients irrespective of whether the surgery was done during the follicular or the luteal phase."
CD004638,"We found 23 potentially relevant trials, of which nine were eligible for inclusion in this review. The nine trials included in our meta-analysis had a total of 808 women. The overall risk of bias of included studies was low, as most studies properly reported their methods. Postoperative pain: Postoperative pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with zero meaning 'no pain at all' and 10 signifying 'pain as bad as it could be.' Postoperative pain was significantly less, as determined by subjectively assessed pain score at six hours (MD -2.40, 95% CI -2.88 to -1.92, one study, 148 women, moderate-quality evidence) and 48 hours postoperatively (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.00, two studies, 80 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) in the laparoscopic myomectomy group compared with the open myomectomy group. This means that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, mean pain score at six hours and 48 hours would be likely to range from about three points lower to one point lower on a VAS zero-to-10 scale. No significant difference in postoperative pain score was noted between the laparoscopic and open myomectomy groups at 24 hours (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.12, four studies, 232 women, I² = 43%, moderate-quality evidence). The overall quality of these findings is moderate; therefore further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. In-hospital adverse events: No evidence suggested a difference in unscheduled return to theatre (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.86, two studies, 188 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) and laparoconversion (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.83, eight studies, 756 women, I² = 53%, moderate-quality evidence) when open myomectomy was compared with laparoscopic myomectomy. Only one study including 148 women reported injury to pelvic organs (no events were described in other studies), and no significant difference was noted between laparoscopic myomectomy and laparoscopically assisted mini-laparotomy myomectomy (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.86). Significantly lower risk of postoperative fever was observed in the laparoscopic myomectomy group compared with groups treated with all types of open myomectomy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77, I² = 0%, six studies, 635 women). This indicates that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, the risk of postoperative fever is 50% lower than among those treated with open surgery. No studies reported immediate hysterectomy, uterine rupture, thromboembolism or mortality. Six studies including 549 women reported haemoglobin drop, but these studies were not pooled because of extreme heterogeneity (I² = 97%) and therefore could not be included in the analysis. Laparoscopic myomectomy is a procedure associated with less subjectively reported postoperative pain, lower postoperative fever and shorter hospital stay compared with all types of open myomectomy. No evidence suggested a difference in recurrence risk between laparoscopic and open myomectomy. More studies are needed to assess rates of uterine rupture, occurrence of thromboembolism, need for repeat myomectomy and hysterectomy at a later stage.","Nine studies including 808 premenopausal women with uterine fibroids compared various methods of myomectomy. These studies were conducted in Italy (seven studies), Austria and China. The evidence is current to July 2014. Myomectomy by laparoscopy is a less painful procedure compared with open surgery. Postoperative pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with zero meaning 'no pain at all' and 10 signifying 'pain as bad as it could be.' Results show that among women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy, the mean pain score at six hours (mean difference (MD) -2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.88 to -1.92) and at 48 hours (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.80 to -1.00) would be likely to range from about three points lower to one point lower on a VAS zero-to-10 scale. Results of our analysis regarding pain score at 24 hours were uncertain (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.12). Risk of fever after the operation was reduced by 50% in women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77). Drop in haemoglobin level (indicating reduced blood loss) could not be compared because results of the analysis were not conclusive because of differences in results with even the same surgical techniques. Risk of injury to intestines and other organs could not be determined in this meta-analysis. No evidence was found of increased risk of recurrence of fibroids after laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.99). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Some outcomes involved small numbers of participants, poor information about blinding in included studies and very wide confidence intervals."
CD006717,"Five small heterogeneous randomised controlled trials, all at high risk of performance bias and most at risk of at least one other type of bias, were included. These involved approximately 200 participants with a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome. All compared taping versus control (no or placebo taping) and all included one or more co-interventions given to both taping and control group participants; this was prescribed exercise in four trials. The intensity and length of treatment was very varied: for example, length of treatment ranged from one week in one trial to three months in another. A meta-analysis of the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain data (scale 0 to 10: worst pain), measured in different ways, from four trials (data from 161 knees), found no statistically or clinically significant difference between taping and non taping in pain at the end of the treatment programmes (mean difference (MD) -0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to 0.85; random-effects model used given the significant heterogeneity (P < 0.0001)). Data for other outcomes measuring function and activities of daily living were from single trials only and gave contradictory results. The currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme. Further research involving large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results is warranted. Before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping.","The review found five trials, involving around 200 participants with this condition, which compared the clinical use of taping with no taping. All five studies differed from each other in terms of the type of participants (one trial involved army recruits), length and schedule of the treatment programme and assessment of outcome. In four trials, participants of both taping and no or placebo taping groups were prescribed exercises. In part because both the therapist and the patient knew whether they were getting taping, some caution was necessary in interpreting the study results. Pooled results from four trials (161 knees) for the level of pain at the end of the treatment programme (ranging for one week to three months) showed no difference between those given taping and those not. Data for other outcomes measuring function and activities of daily living were from single trials only and gave different results. The review concluded that the currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is and low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping. However, before further trials are conducted, some consensus is required to establish the typical patients, taping technique and the best way of measuring outcome."
CD012651,"We included 70 RCTs with a total of 8461 participants randomised to either the intervention or control groups. The number of participants per trial ranged from 16 to 686. Fifty-five trials compared a behaviour-changing intervention with no treatment/usual care control and 15 evaluated the effectiveness of adding an additional component to a behaviour-changing intervention. Sixty-four trials were parallel RCTs, and four were cluster RCTs. Sixty-four trials were multicomponent, two were diet only and four were physical activity only interventions. Ten trials had more than two arms. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low and 62 trials had a high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Total duration of trials ranged from six months to three years. The median age of participants was 10 years old and the median BMI z score was 2.2. Primary analyses demonstrated that behaviour-changing interventions compared to no treatment/usual care control at longest follow-up reduced BMI, BMI z score and weight. Mean difference (MD) in BMI was -0.53 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.24); P < 0.00001; 24 trials; 2785 participants; low-quality evidence. MD in BMI z score was -0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); P = 0.001; 37 trials; 4019 participants; low-quality evidence and MD in weight was -1.45 kg (95% CI -1.88 to -1.02); P < 0.00001; 17 trials; 1774 participants; low-quality evidence. Thirty-one trials reported on serious adverse events, with 29 trials reporting zero occurrences RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.93); P = 0.37; 4/2105 participants in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups). Few trials reported health-related quality of life or behaviour change outcomes, and none of the analyses demonstrated a substantial difference in these outcomes between intervention and control. In two trials reporting on minutes per day of TV viewing, a small reduction of 6.6 minutes per day (95% CI -12.88 to -0.31), P = 0.04; 2 trials; 55 participants) was found in favour of the intervention. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects, and few trials reported on participant views; none of which could be meta-analysed. As the meta-analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses to examine the impact of type of comparator, type of intervention, risk of attrition bias, setting, duration of post-intervention follow-up period, parental involvement and baseline BMI z score. No subgroup effects were shown for any of the subgroups on any of the outcomes. Some data indicated that a reduction in BMI immediately post-intervention was no longer evident at follow-up at less than six months, which has to be investigated in further trials. Multi-component behaviour-changing interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behaviour change may be beneficial in achieving small, short-term reductions in BMI, BMI z score and weight in children aged 6 to 11 years. The evidence suggests a very low occurrence of adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The heterogeneity observed across all outcomes was not explained by subgrouping. Further research is required of behaviour-changing interventions in lower income countries and in children from different ethnic groups; also on the impact of behaviour-changing interventions on health-related quality of life and comorbidities. The sustainability of reduction in BMI/BMI z score and weight is a key consideration and there is a need for longer-term follow-up and further research on the most appropriate forms of post-intervention maintenance in order to ensure intervention benefits are sustained over the longer term.","We found 70 randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments to a variety of control groups delivered to 8461 overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years. We reported on the effects of 64 multicomponent interventions (different combinations of diet and physical activity and behaviour change), four physical activity interventions and two dietary interventions compared with no intervention, 'usual care’ or some other therapy if it was also delivered in the intervention arm. The children in the included studies were followed up between six months and three years. The average age of the children was 10 years. Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex and age, weight, and height changes as children grow older (BMI z score). We summarised the results of 37 trials in 4019 children reporting the BMI z score, which on average was 0.06 units lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 24 trials in 2785 children reporting BMI, which on average was 0.53 kg/m2 lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. We summarised the results of 17 trials in 1774 children reporting weight, which on average was 1.45 kg lower in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. Other effects of the interventions, such as improvements in health-related quality of life were less clear. No study investigated death from any cause, morbidity or socioeconomic effects. Serious adverse events were rare: only two of 31 trials with data reported any serious adverse events (4/2105 participants in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups). This evidence is up to date as of July 2016. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because of limited confidence in how studies were performed, and the results were inconsistent between the studies. Also there were just a few studies for some outcomes, with small numbers of included children."
CD004359,"We included one United Kingdom (UK) study in the review. In this randomised controlled trial, a total of 80 participants, with a mean age of 58 years, were treated for 12 months by a specialist nurse or doctor, then were crossed over to the other clinician for the next 12 months. Two participants died during the study period. Six participants failed to cross over to nurse-led care because of unstable bronchiectasis. Overall, the level of study completion was high. Data show no difference in the numbers of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics (rate ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.30, 80 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Investigators reported more hospital admissions in the nurse-led care group (rate ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.23, 80 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and did not report emergency department attendance. For secondary outcomes, participants in the nurse-led care group used more healthcare resources during the first year of the trial. Increased admissions and greater use of resources made treatment costs for nurse-led groups' higher. Total costs for both years of the study were £8,464 and £5,228 for nurse-led care compared with doctor-led care. However, by the second year, treatment costs were almost equitable between the two groups, which may reflect the nurses' learning of how to better treat people with bronchiectasis. No statistically significant changes were observed in quality of life, exercise capacity, mortality, or lung function. Wide confidence intervals led to uncertainty regarding these results. Adverse events were not an outcome for this review. This update of the review shows that only one trial met review criteria. Review authors were unable to demonstrate effectiveness of nurse-led care compared with doctor-led care on the basis of findings of a single study. The included study reported no significant differences, but limited evidence means that differences in clinical outcomes between nurse-led care and usual care within the setting of a specialist clinic remain unclear. Further research is required to determine whether nurse-led care is cost-effective, if guidelines and protocols for bronchiectasis management are followed does this increases costs and how effective nurse-led management of bronchiectasis is in other clinical settings such as inpatient and outreach.","We found one study from the United Kingdom involving 80 people with bronchiectasis. The study was completed in 2002, when management of bronchiectasis was different from today. Participants were divided into two groups: One group of outpatients was observed for a 12-month period under the care of the specialist nurse, and the other under care of the doctor. After 12 months, these participants swapped groups. We found no significant differences between nurse-led and doctor-led care in terms of lung function, infective flareups (exacerbations), or quality of life. In the first year of the study we noted increased costs for nurse-led care with more hospital admissions and greater use of antibiotic injections. The certainty of evidence in the one included study was satisfactory, given that the study design meant participants knew which group they belonged to. More research is required to determine how nurse specialists compare with doctors in providing safe and effective treatment for patients with stable bronchiectasis. This Cochrane plain language summary was up-to-date as of March 2018."
CD004365,"Only seven studies were included. Major methodological limitations such as small trial size and large confidence intervals decreased the power of the studies to detect differences between treatments, and meta-analysis of data was not possible for the majority of outcomes. Four placebo-controlled trials did not find evidence that antidepressants improved weight gain, eating disorder or associated psychopathology. Isolated findings, favouring amineptine and nortriptyline, emerged from the antidepressant versus antidepressant comparisons, but cannot be conceived as evidence of efficacy of a specific drug or class of antidepressant in light of the findings from the placebo comparisons. Non-completion rates were similar between the compared groups. A lack of quality information precludes us from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations on the use of antidepressants in acute AN. Future studies testing safer and more tolerable antidepressants in larger, well designed trials are needed to provide guidance for clinical practice.","The aim of the present review was to evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant treatment in acute AN. Seven small studies were identified; four placebo-controlled trials did not find evidence of efficacy of antidepressants in improving weight gain, eating disorder or associated symptoms, as well as differences in completion rates. Meta-analysis of data was not possible for most outcomes. However, major methodological limitations of these studies (e.g. insufficient power to detect differences) prevent from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations for antidepressant use in acute AN. Further studies testing safer antidepressants in larger and well designed trials are needed to guide clinical practice."
CD001211,"We included 21 eligible RCTs, 10 of which were newly identified in this update. A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non-FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non-FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty. The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.","We examined whether antibiotics alone or in combination with steroid, can improve signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis or help clear the associated bacteria. We also evaluated whether antibiotics would result in undesirable effects on the eyes. We performed a systematic review by searching for studies that compared antibiotics in eyedrop, ointment, or tablet form with inactive controls. We summarized these study findings and reported the results together with our level of confidence in them based on how studies were conducted. We found that antibiotics likely increase clinical cure and microbiological cure after a course of treatment in comparison with placebo. Antibiotic use also is associated with fewer participants stopping their treatment earlier than they are supposed to. However, for some individuals, non-fluroquinolone but not fluoroquinolone antibiotics, may result in more unwanted effects on the eyes or eyelids than placebo though we were very uncertain about the relevant evidence. There was no evidence that antibiotics were associated with systemic side effects such as headache or altered sense of smell. The current update focused on adults and children aged one month or older. Therefore, the evidence does not pertain to antibiotic treatment for neonatal conjunctivitis in neonates younger than one month old. We did not find studies that compared effects of the same antibiotics used in short versus long duration. Therefore, the current review was unable to suggest for or against the prescription duration for acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The evidence is up-to-date as of April 2022."
CD002286,"We identified one new study for this update, resulting in six trials (561 patients) meeting the inclusion criteria. Five of the six trials reported on the main outcome, migraine frequency. Although five of the trials were generally of good methodological quality, all studies were either of unclear or high risk of bias with regards to sample size. Pooled analysis of the results was not possible due to the lack of common outcome measures and heterogeneity between studies in terms of participants, interventions and designs. The most recent trial added to this version of the review is rigorous and larger (n = 218), using a stable feverfew extract at a dose determined by a previous dose-finding trial. It reports that feverfew reduced migraine frequency by 1.9 attacks from 4.8 to 2.9 and placebo by 1.3 from to 4.8 to 3.5 per month, resulting in a difference in effect between feverfew and placebo of 0.6 attacks per month. For the secondary outcome measures intensity and duration of migraine attacks, incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting, and global assessment no statistically significant differences were reported. Results of previous trials are not convincing: three trials reporting positive effects of feverfew are all of small sample size (17 to 60 participants), while two rigorous trials (n = 50, 147) did not find significant differences between feverfew and placebo. Only mild and transient adverse events, most commonly gastrointestinal complaints and mouth ulcers, were reported in the included trials. Since the last version of this review, one larger rigorous study has been included, reporting a difference in effect between feverfew and placebo of 0.6 attacks per month. This adds some positive evidence to the mixed and inconclusive findings of the previous review. However, this constitutes low quality evidence, which needs to be confirmed in larger rigorous trials with stable feverfew extracts and clearly defined migraine populations before firm conclusions can be drawn. It appears from the data reviewed that feverfew is not associated with any major safety concerns.","For this update of a previous Cochrane review, we reviewed the available evidence up to January 2015 for or against feverfew in the prevention of migraine and found six studies including 561 participants. Generally the studies were heterogeneous and their results were mixed. The previous version of this review showed no clear benefit of feverfew compared with placebo. We added a new study, which is larger and was carried out to high standards, to this review. It showed that feverfew reduced migraine frequency by a little more than half a migraine (0.6) per month compared to placebo. There was no difference in how severe the pain was, or how long it lasted. These results come from a single study of moderate size, therefore they must be viewed with caution until they are confirmed in other rigorous studies. No major adverse effects were associated with feverfew in the included studies."
CD005486,"Three RCTs were identified, comprising a total of 847 participants. One trial compared silver-containing foam (Contreet®) with hydrocellular foam (Allevyn®) in patients with leg ulcers. The second trial compared a silver-containing alginate (Silvercel®) with an alginate alone (Algosteril®). The third trial compared a silver-containing foam dressing (Contreet®)) with best local practice in patients with chronic wounds. The data from these trials show that silver-containing foam dressings did not significantly increase complete ulcer healing as compared with standard foam dressings or best local practice after up to four weeks of follow-up, although a greater reduction of ulcer size was observed with the silver-containing foam. The use of antibiotics was assessed in two trials, but no significant differences were found. Data on pain, patient satisfaction, length of hospital stay, and costs were limited and showed no differences. Leakage occurred significantly less frequently in patients with leg ulcers and chronic wounds treated with a silver dressing than with a standard foam dressing or best local practice in one trial. Only three trials with a short follow-up duration were found. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of silver-containing dressings or topical agents for treatment of infected or contaminated chronic wounds.",Three studies looking at people with chronic wounds were included in the review and found that silver-containing foam dressings did not result in faster wound healing after up to four weeks of follow-up. One study did find that the overall size of the ulcer reduced more quickly when dressed with a silver-containing foam. There is no enough evidence to recommend the use of silver-containing dressings or topical agents for treating infected or contaminated chronic wounds.
CD001760,"Five studies were included, of which four with a total of 282 participants provided data. No meta-analysis was possible due to heterogeneity of comparisons within included studies as well as inadequate reporting of data. All studies were considered to be at either moderate or high risk of bias. The results of this systematic review indicate that there is no clinical or statistical difference between systematic desensitisation and any of the control interventions (either waiting list control, systematic desensitisation combined with group therapy or in vitro (with women under instruction by the therapist) desensitisation) for the treatment of vaginismus. The drop-out rates were higher in the waiting list groups. A clinically relevant effect of systematic desensitisation when compared with any of the control interventions cannot be ruled out. None of the included trials compared other behaviour therapies (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy, sex therapy) to pharmacological interventions. The findings are limited by the evidence available and as such conclusions about the efficacy of interventions for the treatment of vaginismus should be drawn cautiously.","This review found five poor to moderate quality studies, of which four with a total of 282 women provided data. There was not enough evidence to say if systematic desensitisation worked better than another treatment. Further studies including larger numbers of women are needed to show if systematic desensitisation if effective for the treatment of women with vaginismus."
CD004302,"Two trials with a total population of 1300 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients who were randomized to treatment with subcutaneous injections of recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor or placebo were examined in this review. The risk of bias was low for one trial but was unclear for the other trial. No new trials were found on updating the search in April 2011. The methodological quality of these trials was considered adequate. No significant difference was observed between ciliary neurotrophic factor and placebo groups for survival, the primary outcome measure. The risk ratio was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.41). No significant differences between the groups were observed for most of the secondary outcomes. However, a significant increase of the incidence of several adverse events was noted in groups treated with higher doses of ciliary neurotrophic factor. Ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment had no significant effect on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression. At high concentrations, several side effects were observed. A combination of ciliary neurotrophic factor with other neurotrophic factors (as suggested by results on animal models) and more efficient delivery methods should be tested.","Ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment did not show any significant effect on the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and side effects were observed at high concentrations.The review found only two eligible trials with a total of 1300 participants; the risk of bias was low for one trial but was unclear for the other trial; they did not show any significant effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor on progression of ALS or MND in man. On the other hand, several adverse effects were observed after treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor. An updated search was performed in April 2011, but no new studies were found."
CD011609,"We identified only one study for inclusion in this review. This study was a prospective, double-blind cross-over trial that compared the effect of systemic metronidazole with a placebo on odour in malignant wounds. Nine participants with a fungating wound and for whom the smell was troublesome were recruited and six of these completed both the intervention and control (placebo) stages of the trial. Each stage lasted fourteen days, with a fourteen day gap (washout period) between administration of the metronidazole and the placebo. The study, in comparing metronidazole and placebo, reported on two of this review's pre-specified primary outcomes (malodour and adverse effects of the treatment) and on none of the review's pre-specified secondary outcomes. Malodour
The mean malodour (smell) scores for the metronidazole group was 1.17 (standard deviation (SD) 1.60) and the mean for the placebo group was 3.33 (SD 0.82). It is unclear if systemic antibiotics were associated with a difference in malodour (1 study with 6 participants; MD —2.16, 95% CI —3.6 to —0.72) as the quality of the evidence (GRADE) was very low for this outcome. The study was downgraded due to high risk of attrition bias (33% loss to follow-up) and very serious imprecision due to the small sample size. Adverse effects
No adverse effects of the treatment were reported in either the intervention or control group by the trial authors. It is uncertain whether systemic metronidazole leads to a reduction in malodour in patients with malignant wounds. This is because we were only able to include a single study at high risk of bias with a very small sample size, which focused only on patients with breast cancer. More research is needed to substantiate these findings and to investigate the effects of systemic metronidazole and other antibiotics on quality of life, pain relief, exudate and tumour containment in patients with malignant wounds.","In March 2017 we searched for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of systemic antibiotics on malignant wounds. We found only one trial, dating from 1984, which compared the effectiveness of the antibiotic metronidazole with a placebo (sugar pill) on six participants with malignant wounds resulting from breast cancer. The trial was a cross-over trial which means that participants receive both the treatment being tested and the comparison treatment, at different time-points, with a break between the treatments to ensure that the effects of the first treatment have worn off before the second treatment is taken. This is called the 'washout' period. In the one trial in this review, half the participants took the antibiotic first, for 14 days, and half took the placebo. Both groups then had 14 days with no medication before swapping over (cross-over) and trying the alternative treatment for 14 days. It is unclear if metronidazole reduces the smell of malignant wounds when taken orally (by mouth) in tablet form, without any side effects occurring. Its effectiveness in relation to other outcomes such as pain or quality of life was not measured in this trial. No change in the size or appearance of participants' tumours was reported. It is uncertain whether metronidazole reduces the smell of malignant wounds when taken orally in tablet form because the quality of the evidence is very low. This evidence came from a very small study with serious study design flaws, and more research is needed involving more people with different types of cancer. Trials looking at how antibiotics can affect other outcomes, such as quality of life, pain relief and reducing any bleeding or ooze from the wound are also needed. This plain language summary is up to date as of March 2017."
CD013029,"We included two published RCTs from single centres in the UK and Canada, which recruited 60 participants (60 eyes) and 30 participants (46 eyes) respectively. Participants in these trials were people with non-exudative AMD with Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) categories 2 to 4. One study compared single wavelength PBM with no treatment. This study was at risk of performance bias because the study was not masked, and there was attrition bias. One study compared multi-wavelength PBM with sham treatment and conflicts of interest were reported by study investigators. We also identified three eligible ongoing RCTs from searching the clinical trials database. When comparing PBM with sham treatment or no treatment for non-exudative AMD, there was no evidence of any meaningful clinical difference in BCVA at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 0.02 logMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.05; 2 RCTs, 90 eyes; low-certainty evidence). One study comparing multi-wavelength PBM with sham treatment showed an improvement in contrast sensitivity at Level E (18 cycles/degree) at 12 months (MD 0.29 LogCS, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.35; 1 RCT, 46 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Visual function and health-related quality of life scores were comparable between single wavelength PBM and no treatment groups at 12 months (VFQ-48 score MD 0.43, 95% CI -0.17 to 1.03; P = 0.16; 1 RCT, 47 eyes; low-certainty evidence). When comparing PBM with sham treatment or no treatment for non-exudative AMD, there was no evidence of any meaningful clinical difference in conversion to exudative AMD (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.17 to 5.44; 2 RCTs, 96 eyes; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 months. There was inconclusive evidence that single wavelength PBM prevents the progression of AMD (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.53; P = 0.48; 1 RCT, 50 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Disease progression was defined as the development of advanced AMD or significant increase in drusen volume. No included study reported near vision, low luminance vision or reading speed outcomes. Currently there remains uncertainty whether PBM treatment is beneficial in slowing progression of non-exudative macular degeneration. There is a need for further well-designed controlled trials assessing dosimetry, powered for both effectiveness and safety outcomes. Consideration should be given to the adoption of agreed clinical outcome measures and patient-based outcome measures for AMD.","First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. We found two studies that involved a total of 90 people with dry AMD. Both studies received public funding. In one study, with 60 people, set in the UK, 30 people wore a light-emitting eye mask for eight hours every night for one year. Their results were compared to those of 30 people who received no treatment. In the other study, with 30 people, set in Canada, people received either:
→ low level light therapy for five minutes per eye, three times a week for three weeks, which was repeated after a six-month break; or
→ a sham treatment, three times a week for three weeks, which was repeated after a six-month break. Five of the investigators of this study had links to the manufacturer of the light therapy device used (three of these were employed by the manufacturer). We have little to very little confidence in the evidence we found, because it is based on only two small studies. The way these studies were conducted is likely to have introduced errors in their results. The evidence suggests that:
→ photobiomodulation may make little or no difference to changes in clarity of vision one year after starting treatment compared to no treatment or a sham treatment;
→ photobiomodulation may make little or no difference to disease progression of AMD after one year;
→ photobiomodulation may improve a person’s ability to distinguish an object against its background;
→ photobiomodulation may make little or no difference to clarity of vision as reported by patients. We have too little confidence in the evidence to be able to determine whether, after one year of treatment, photobiomodulation affects:
→ progression to wet AMD. Since neither study reported information about some outcomes, we cannot determine from the evidence whether, after one year of treatment, photobiomodulation affects:
→ near vision;
→ vision in low light; or
→ reading speed. Compared to no treatment or a sham treatment, photobiomodulation may make little or no difference to clarity of vision or disease progression in people with dry AMD one year after starting treatment. We do not know if photobiomodulation affects other aspects such as progression to wet AMD or changes in near vision. This is because too few, or no, robust studies have investigated this. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020."
CD012330,"We included four studies that compared SDM versus control and included a total of 1342 participants. Three studies recruited children with asthma and their care-givers, and one recruited adults with asthma. Three studies took place in the United States, and one in the Netherlands. Trial duration was between 6 and 24 months. One trial delivered the SDM intervention to the medical practitioner, and three trials delivered the SDM intervention directly to the participant. Two paediatric studies involved use of an online portal, followed by face-to-face consultations. One study delivered an SDM intervention or a clinical decision-making intervention through a mixture of face-to-face consultations and telephone calls. The final study randomised paediatric general practice physicians to receive a seminar programme promoting application of SDM principles. All trials were open-label, although one study, which delivered the intervention to physicians, stated that participants were unaware of their physicians' involvement in the trial. We had concerns about selection and attrition bias and selective reporting, and we noted that one study substantially under-recruited participants. The four included studies used different approaches to measure fidelity/intervention adherence and to report study findings. One study involving adults with poorly controlled asthma reported improved quality of life (QOL) for the SDM group compared with the control group, using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) for assessment (mean difference (MD) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 2.91), but two other trials did not identify a benefit. Patient/parent satisfaction with the performance of paediatricians was greater in the SDM group in one trial involving children. Medication adherence was better in the SDM group in two studies - one involving adults and one involving children (all medication adherence: MD 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.31; mean number of controlled medication prescriptions over 26 weeks: 1.1 in the SDM group (n = 26) and 0.7 in the control group (n = 27)). In one study, asthma-related visit rates were lower in the SDM group than in the usual care group (1.0/y vs 1.4/y; P = 0.016), but two other studies did not report a difference in exacerbations nor in prescriptions for short courses of oral steroids. Finally, one study described better odds of reporting no asthma problems in the SDM group than in the usual care group (odds ratio (OR) 1.90, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.87), although two other studies reporting asthma control did not identify a benefit with SDM. We found no information about acceptability of the intervention to the healthcare professional and no information on adverse events. Overall, our confidence in study results ranged from very low to moderate, and we downgraded outcomes owing to risk of bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Substantial differences between the four included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that we cannot provide meaningful overall conclusions. Individual studies demonstrated some benefits of SDM over control, in terms of quality of life; patient and parent satisfaction; adherence to prescribed medication; reduction in asthma-related healthcare visits; and improved asthma control. Our confidence in the findings of these individual studies ranges from moderate to very low, and it is important to note that studies did not measure or report adverse events. Future trials should be adequately powered and of sufficient duration to detect differences in patient-important outcomes such as exacerbations and hospitalisations. Use of core asthma outcomes and validated scales when possible would facilitate future meta-analysis. Studies conducted in lower-income settings and including an economic evaluation would be of interest. Investigators should systematically record adverse events, even if none are anticipated. Studies identified to date have not included adolescents; future trials should consider their inclusion. Measuring and reporting of intervention fidelity is also recommended.","We reviewed the evidence up to November 2016. We found four studies, including 1342 people, that attempted to answer this question. All participants had asthma; participants in three studies were children and those in one study were adults. Three studies took place in the United States and one in the Netherlands; studies lasted from six months to two years. Different studies used different methods of shared decision-making, including face-to-face discussions, telephone calls, and online messages. Because these studies were conducted in different ways, we were unable to combine their findings. We found evidence from individual studies indicating that shared decision-making may improve quality of life and asthma control and may reduce healthcare visits for asthma. Shared decision-making may also help people to take their asthma inhaler(s) more regularly owing to better understanding of why they need to do that. Going through this process may make people feel more satisfied with their care, as they may feel empowered about making choices. However, all of these findings were reported by different studies, and some studies showed benefit of shared decision-making, while others did not. It is important to mention that none of these studies looked into whether shared decision-making causes unwanted side effects. All four studies measured how well the shared decision-making intervention had been delivered or received but did this in different ways. We were not very confident in the quality of the evidence presented in this review. We were concerned about the small number of studies and about differences in the way included studies were designed. Also, participants knew which group they were in (i.e. shared decision-making or standard care), and this may have affected how they answered questions about their asthma during the trial. Some evidence suggests that shared decision-making might help people with asthma, but we are not sure whether it is helpful. In the future, larger studies that include adolescents while looking out for side effects, harms, and benefits should prove useful in answering this question."
CD010844,"We identified 71 RCTs randomly assigning 73,062 people with COPD to 184 treatment arms of interest. Trials were similar with regards to methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria and key baseline characteristics. Participants were more often male, aged in their mid sixties, with FEV1 predicted normal between 40% and 50% and with substantial smoking histories (40+ pack-years). The risk of bias was generally low, although missing information made it hard to judge risk of selection bias and selective outcome reporting. Fixed effects were used for SGRQ analyses, and random effects for Trough FEV1 analyses, based on model fit statistics and deviance information criteria (DIC). SGRQ 
SGRQ data were available in 42 studies (n = 54,613). At six months, 39 pairwise comparisons were made between 18 treatments in 25 studies (n = 27,024). Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked intervention, with a mean improvement over placebo of -3.89 units at six months (95% credible interval (CrI) -4.70 to -2.97) and -3.60 at 12 months (95% CrI -4.63 to -2.34). LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third at six months, with mean differences of -2.63 (95% CrI -3.53 to -1.97) and -2.29 (95% CrI -3.18 to -1.53), respectively. Inhaled corticosteroids were ranked fourth (MD -2.00, 95% CrI -3.06 to -0.87). Class differences between LABA, LAMA and ICS were less prominent at 12 months. Indacaterol and aclidinium were ranked somewhat higher than other members of their classes, and formoterol 12 mcg, budesonide 400 mcg and formoterol/mometasone combination were ranked lower within their classes. There was considerable overlap in credible intervals and rankings for both classes and individual treatments. Trough FEV1  
Trough FEV1 data were available in 46 studies (n = 47,409). At six months, 41 pairwise comparisons were made between 20 treatments in 31 studies (n = 29,271). As for SGRQ, combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked class, with a mean improvement over placebo of 133.3 mL at six months (95% CrI 100.6 to 164.0) and slightly less at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 100, 95% CrI 55.5 to 140.1). LAMAs (MD 103.5, 95% CrI 81.8 to 124.9) and LABAs (MD 99.4, 95% CrI 72.0 to 127.8) showed roughly equivalent results at six months, and ICSs were the fourth ranked class (MD 65.4, 95% CrI 33.1 to 96.9). As with SGRQ, initial differences between classes were not so prominent at 12 months. Indacaterol and salmeterol/fluticasone were ranked slightly better than others in their class, and formoterol 12, aclidinium, budesonide and formoterol/budesonide combination were ranked lower within their classes. All credible intervals for individual rankings were wide. This network meta-analysis compares four different classes of long-acting inhalers for people with COPD who need more than short-acting bronchodilators. Quality of life and lung function were improved most on combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and at 12 months. Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 months. The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1 that was less than 50% predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased adverse events (which has been established by other reviews) require consideration. Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.","We found 71 relevant studies, but not all measured the outcomes we were interested in. Forty-two studies were included in the quality of life analyses (measured on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), and 46 were included in the lung function analyses. Evidence from good quality and similar trials supported LABA/ICS combinations as the most likely treatment strategy to bring the greatest improvement to quality of life and lung function. Combination therapy gave an average benefit of 3.9 units over placebo at six months. LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third at six months (-2.63 and -2.29 units, respectively), especially when unreliable trials were not included, but a large degree of overlap in the estimates was noted. Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked class for trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), with mean improvement over placebo of 133 mL at six months (95% credible Interval (CrI) 101 to 164). As was the case for SGRQ, LAMAs (mean difference (MD) 104, 95% CrI 82 to 125) were ranked just ahead of LABAs (MD 99, 95% CrI 72 to 128) at six months, and ICSs were the lowest ranked class (MD 65, 95% CrI 33 to 97). For both outcomes, the effects of LABA and ICS used alone appeared to increase when used together for six months, but initial differences between the treatment classes were less obvious after a year of treatment. Quality of life and lung function were improved most on combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and 12 months. Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 months. The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1that was less than 50% predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased adverse events (which has been shown by other reviews) require consideration. Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines."
CD011818,"We included nine RCTs involving 407 adults with asthma in this review; no studies included adolescents under 18. Study size ranged from 10 to 94 (median 40), and mean age ranged from 39 to 53. Study populations generally had persistent asthma, but severity and diagnostic measures varied. Three studies recruited participants with psychological symptomatology, although with different criteria. Interventions ranged from 4 to 15 sessions, and primary measurements were taken at a mean of 3 months (range 1.2 to 12 months). Participants given CBT had improved scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (MD 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.93; participants = 214; studies = 6; I2 = 53%) and on measures of asthma control (SMD -0.98, 95% CI -1.76 to -0.20; participants = 95; studies = 3; I2 = 68%) compared to people getting usual care. The AQLQ effect appeared to be sustained up to a year after treatment, but due to its low quality this evidence must be interpreted with caution. As asthma exacerbations requiring at least a course of oral steroids were not consistently reported, we could not perform a meta-analysis. Anxiety scores were difficult to pool but showed a benefit of CBT compared with usual care (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.03), although this depended on the analysis used. The confidence intervals for the effect on depression scales included no difference between CBT and usual care when measured as change from baseline (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.05) or endpoint scores (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.05); the same was true for medication adherence (MD -1.40, 95% CI -2.94 to 0.14; participants = 23; studies = 1; I2 = 0%). Subgroup analyses conducted on the AQLQ outcome did not suggest a clear difference between individual and group CBT, baseline psychological status, or CBT model. The small number of studies and the variation between their designs, populations, and other intervention characteristics limited the conclusions that could be drawn about these possibly moderating factors. The inability to blind participants and investigators to group allocation introduced significant potential bias, and overall we had low confidence in the evidence. For adults with persistent asthma, CBT may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels compared with usual care. Risks of bias, imprecision of effects, and inconsistency between results reduced our confidence in the results to low, and evidence was lacking regarding the effect of CBT on asthma exacerbations, unscheduled contacts, depression, and medication adherence. There was much variation between studies in how CBT was delivered and what constituted usual care, meaning the most optimal method of CBT delivery, format, and target population requires further investigation. There is currently no evidence for the use of CBT in adolescents with asthma.","The evidence reviewed is current to August 2016. We included nine studies with a total of 407 participants in the review. All of the participants had asthma. In three of the nine studies, the participants also had a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or both. The CBT was given either individually or in a group and ranged from four to 15 sessions. Participants given CBT had improved scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and on measures of asthma control compared to participants who did not receive CBT. The studies generally did not report whether CBT reduced the likelihood of people needing oral steroids for an asthma attack. The benefit on AQLQ score was sustained up to a year after receiving CBT. Participants given CBT also had better anxiety scores compared to those given usual care. Participants given CBT did not have clearly improved depression scale scores or medication adherence. The overall quality of evidence presented is low due to the small number of studies included in the review, the differences in the design of the studies and in how the CBT was conducted, and because the participants knew to which treatment group (CBT or no CBT) they had been assigned."
CD000493,"We included 26 trials involving 2007 women. They were mostly at unclear to high risk of bias. They assessed nine different pharmacological interventions, resulting in 14 different comparisons. We judged two placebo-controlled trials of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in 715 women to be at low risk of bias. The ten different pharmacological interventions were: agents believed to detoxify bile acids (UCDA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe); agents used to bind bile acids in the intestine (activated charcoal, guar gum, cholestyramine); Chinese herbal medicines (yinchenghao decoction (YCHD), salvia, Yiganling and Danxioling pill (DXLP)), and agents aimed to reduce bile acid production (dexamethasone)
Compared with placebo, UDCA probably results in a small improvement in pruritus score measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (mean difference (MD) −7.64 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.69 to −5.60 points; 2 trials, 715 women; GRADE moderate certainty), where a score of zero indicates no itch and a score of 100 indicates severe itching. The evidence for fetal distress and stillbirth were uncertain, due to serious limitations in study design and imprecision (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.40; 6 trials, 944 women; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.37; 6 trials, 955 women; GRADE very low certainty). We found very few differences for the other comparisons included in this review. There is insufficient evidence to indicate if SAMe, guar gum, activated charcoal, dexamethasone, cholestyramine, Salvia, Yinchenghao decoction, Danxioling and Yiganling, or Yiganling alone or in combination are effective in treating women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. When compared with placebo, UDCA administered to women with ICP probably shows a reduction in pruritus. However the size of the effect is small and for most pregnant women and clinicians, the reduction may fall below the minimum clinically worthwhile effect. The evidence was unclear for other adverse fetal outcomes, due to very low-certainty evidence. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that SAMe, guar gum, activated charcoal, dexamethasone, cholestyramine, YCHD, DXLP, Salvia, Yiganling alone or in combination are effective in treating women with cholestasis of pregnancy. There are no trials of the efficacy of topical emollients. Further high-quality trials of other interventions are needed in order to identify effective treatments for maternal itching and preventing adverse perinatal outcomes. It would also be helpful to identify those women who are mostly likely to respond to UDCA (for example, whether bile acid concentrations affect how women with ICP respond to treatment with UDCA).","We searched for evidence in December 2019, and identified 26 trials involving 2007 women. The trials assessed nine different interventions, but for most of them the trials were small and had a high risk of bias; we were therefore unable to draw firm conclusions. However, the most widely-used treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), for which we identified seven trials (1008 women), included two trials at low risk of bias (755 women). There is now evidence that UDCA probably reduces itching (moderate-certainty evidence). However, the size of the effect is small and for many pregnant women may not be worthwhile. The evidence for an effect of UCDA on stillbirth or fetal distress is unclear, mainly due to limitations in study design and imprecise results (very low-certainty evidence). Although UDCA has not been shown to prevent the adverse outcomes of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, there is no other effective treatment for this condition, and there is a small reduction in maternal itch. More high-quality trials of other treatments are needed in order to identify what is effective for maternal itching and to prevent adverse outcomes. It would also be helpful to identify those women who are mostly likely to respond to UDCA (for example, whether bile acid concentrations affect how women with ICP respond to treatment with UDCA)."
CD004804,"We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15519 patients. The studies were conducted in nine countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from two to 60 months. Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8 per cent to 19.6 per cent. Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent. Complex interventions involving more than one technique increased adherence in eight out of 18 studies, ranging from 5 per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful. Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy, although there is less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed RCTs.","For many interventions it is difficult to draw any real conclusions due to weaknesses of the included studies. However, reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy although there is little evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed randomised controlled trials to confirm these findings."
CD011995,"We included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2%) saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six-month period; the other compared 5 ml nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Large-volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care
One trial included 76 adult participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without polyps.Disease-specific HRQL  was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 6.3 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 11.71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13.5 points, 95% CI 9.63 to 17.37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported disease severity  was evaluated using a ""single-item sinus symptom severity assessment"" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented. No adverse effects  data were collected in the control group but 23% of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including epistaxis. General HRQL  was measured using SF-12 (0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). No difference was found after three months of treatment (low quality evidence) but at six months there was a small difference favouring the saline group, which may not be of clinical significance and has high uncertainty (MD 10.5 points, 95% CI 0.66 to 20.34) (very low quality evidence). Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids
One trial included 40 adult participants with polyps. Our primary outcome of disease-specific HRQL  was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) the patients who had intranasal corticosteroids had less severe symptoms  (MD -13.50, 95% CI -14.44 to -12.56); this corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be of very low quality. The two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there is no benefit of a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids. There is some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low for three months and very low for six months of treatment.","We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 116 adult participants in this review. One compared large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six-month period. The other compared 5 ml of nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Both of these studies had important limitations in their methodology and we considered them to have a high risk of bias. Large-volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care
In the small trial of 76 participants our primary outcome of 'disease-specific health-related quality of life' was reported using a 0- to 100-point scale. At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group and at six months of treatment there was a greater effect. We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported disease severity was also evaluated but the trialists did not state the range of scores used, which made it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented. No adverse effects data were collected in the control group but 23% of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including nosebleeds (epistaxis). General health-related quality of life was also measured in this study. No difference was found after three months of treatment but at six months there was a small difference (although the result is uncertain). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality. Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids
One small trial had 20 patients in each of the two arms being compared. Our primary outcome of disease-specific health-related quality of life was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) there was an improvement in symptoms. The two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there was no benefit of a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids, but there may be some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution compared with placebo, although the quality of the evidence was low for three months and very low for six months of treatment."
CD004431,"Overall 16 studies were identified and included. MR1: three trials (n=145). Some evidence of effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation on cognitive outcomes, although this was difficult to interpret because of the large number of outcome measures used. MR2: three trials (n=80). One small trial suggesting psychotherapy may help with depression. MR3: seven studies (n=688). Some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy may help people adjust to, and cope with, having MS (three trials). The other trials were diverse in nature and some difficult to interpret because of multiple outcome measures. MR4: three trials (n=93). Two small studies of cognitive behavioural therapy showed significant improvements in depression. The diversity of psychological interventions identified indicates the many ways in which they can potentially help people with MS. No definite conclusions can be made from this review. However there is reasonable evidence that cognitive behavioural approaches are beneficial in the treatment of depression, and in helping people adjust to, and cope with, having MS.","Sixteen relevant studies were identified and included in this review. They have researched a variety of different interventions, having different purposes, and so a single overall definite conclusion cannot be made. However the authors cautiously conclude that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a therapy that addresses thoughts and behaviours, can help people with MS adjust to, and cope with, having MS, and can help them if they get depressed. Psychological interventions can potentially help people with MS in many ways, including the management of symptoms such as pain and fatigue. Additional studies are needed, particularly those that include larger numbers of people."
CD004896,"Three trials met the inclusion criteria. Two trials (n = 20,451) assessed the effect of TXA. The larger of these (CRASH-2, n = 20,211) was conducted in 40 countries and included patients with a variety of types of trauma; the other (n = 240) restricted itself to those with traumatic brain injury (TBI) only. One trial (n = 77) assessed aprotinin in participants with major bony trauma and shock. The pooled data show that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce the risk of death from any cause by 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; P = 0.002) (quality of evidence: high). This estimate is based primarily on data from the CRASH-2 trial of TXA, which contributed 99% of the data. There is no evidence that antifibrinolytics have an effect on the risk of vascular occlusive events (quality of evidence: moderate), need for surgical intervention or receipt of blood transfusion (quality of evidence: high). There is no evidence for a difference in the effect by type of antifibrinolytic (TXA versus aprotinin) however, as the pooled analyses were based predominantly on trial data concerning the effects of TXA, the results can only be confidently applied to the effects of TXA. The effects of aprotinin in this patient group remain uncertain. There is some evidence from pooling data from one study (n = 240) and a subset of data from CRASH-2 (n = 270) in patients with TBI which suggest that TXA may reduce mortality although the estimates are imprecise, the quality of evidence is low, and uncertainty remains. Stronger evidence exists for the possibility of TXA reducing intracranial bleeding in this population. TXA safely reduces mortality in trauma patients with bleeding without increasing the risk of adverse events. TXA should be given as early as possible and within three hours of injury, as further analysis of the CRASH-2 trial showed that treatment later than this is unlikely to be effective and may be harmful. Although there is some promising evidence for the effect of TXA in patients with TBI, substantial uncertainty remains. Two ongoing trials being conducted in patients with isolated TBI should resolve these remaining uncertainties.","We found three randomised trials which met inclusion criteria and included well data from over 20,000 patients recruited in 40 countries. Of these, one small trial (n = 77) looked at the effect of aprotinin in patients aged 12 and older who had suffered trauma involving broken bones and shock. Two trials assessed the effect of TXA in patients aged 16 and over. The largest (n = 20,211) involved patients suffering from a variety of types of trauma, and the other (n = 240) only those who had suffered traumatic brain injury. The trial assessing the effect of aprotinin was too small to provide reliable data. Results for TXA suggest that, when given early, TXA reduces the risk of death compared to patients who do not receive TXA without increasing the risk of side effects. However, there is still some uncertainty about the effect of TXA in patients who have bleeding inside the brain from a head injury, but are not bleeding from injuries elsewhere. It is possible that the effects of TXA are different in this specific patient group. We have found two ongoing trials that are trying to answer this question. The authors of this review conclude that TXA can safely reduce death in trauma patients with bleeding and should be given as soon as possible after injury. However, they cannot conclude whether or not TXA is also effective in patients with traumatic brain injury with no other trauma, until the ongoing trials have been completed. Evidence for important outcomes including mortality, need for further surgery and blood transfusion, came from high-quality evidence, meaning we have confidence in the findings. There was moderate-quality evidence for important adverse events including vascular occlusive events (including heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and pulmonary embolism)."
CD001914,"Four studies (187 children) met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were carried out in children with cystic fibrosis and one study included children with paediatric malignant disease. Overall there was a low risk of bias for blinding and incomplete outcome data.Two studies had a high risk of bias for allocation concealment. Few statistical differences were found in the outcomes we assessed between treatment and control groups, except change in total energy intake at six and 12 months, mean difference 304.86 kcal per day (95% confidence interval 5.62 to 604.10) and mean difference 265.70 kcal per day (95% confidence interval 42.94 to 485.46), respectively. However, these were based on the analysis of just 58 children in only one study. Only two chronic diseases were included in these analyses, cystic fibrosis and paediatric malignant disease. No other studies were identified which assessed the effectiveness of oral protein calorie supplements in children with other chronic diseases. Oral protein calorie supplements are widely used to improve the nutritional status of children with a number of chronic diseases. We identified a small number of studies assessing these products in children with cystic fibrosis and paediatric malignant disease, but were unable to draw any conclusions based on the limited data extracted. We recommend a series of large, randomised controlled trials be undertaken investigating the use of these products in children with different chronic diseases. Until further data are available, we suggest these products are used with caution.","We looked for trials of oral protein calorie supplements compared to usual treatment or no alternative treatment where the children took the supplements for at least one month. The review included four trials with 187 children; in three of these the children had cystic fibrosis and in one they had cancer. Studies lasted from three months to one year. We recorded the results and judged whether the trials were at risk of being biased based on the design or the way it was run. We looked at outcomes such as weight and height, calorie intake, behaviour and also side effects. One study (with 58 children) showed increases in the total calories consumed at both six and 12 months. None of the other outcomes we looked at showed any difference between treatments. This is an updated version of the review, which found no conclusive evidence to support the use of oral protein supplements. We suggest that at least one high quality trial be conducted.Therefore, we suggest that these products are used sparingly and with caution. Overall the included studies had a low risk of bias, except for two studies in which it was possible that the organisers knew which treatment group in which the children would be placed. These issues are unlikely to change the results as knowing which treatment one receives is unlikely to affect the results of body measurements (e.g. weight, height outcomes). All planned outcomes were reported on, with the exception of one study that did not report on eating behaviour and lipase intake which were measured. The quality of the results for the eating behaviour assessment was questionable and many of the children did not return the food diaries from which the lipase intake could be calculated."
CD007025,"We included a total of 84 trials (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting interventions in higher risk individuals or settings. Studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short-term reporting or publication bias. Overall, the risk of bias assessment showed that these studies provided moderate or low quality evidence. At four or more months follow-up, we found effects in favour of MI for the quantity of alcohol consumed (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.15 to −0.06 or a reduction from 13.7 drinks/week to 12.5 drinks/week; moderate quality evidence); frequency of alcohol consumption (SMD −0.14, 95% CI −0.21 to −0.07 or a reduction in the number of days/week alcohol was consumed from 2.74 days to 2.52 days; moderate quality evidence); and peak blood alcohol concentration, or BAC (SMD −0.12, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.05, or a reduction from 0.144% to 0.131%; moderate quality evidence). We found a marginal effect in favour of MI for alcohol problems (SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.00 or a reduction in an alcohol problems scale score from 8.91 to 8.18; low quality evidence) and no effects for binge drinking (SMD −0.04, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.02, moderate quality evidence) or for average BAC (SMD −0.05, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.08; moderate quality evidence). We also considered other alcohol-related behavioural outcomes, and at four or more months follow-up, we found no effects on drink-driving (SMD −0.13, 95% CI −0.36 to 0.10; moderate quality of evidence) or other alcohol-related risky behaviour (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.01; moderate quality evidence). Further analyses showed that there was no clear relationship between the duration of the MI intervention (in minutes) and effect size. Subgroup analyses revealed no clear subgroup effects for longer-term outcomes (four or more months) for assessment only versus alternative intervention controls; for university/college vs other settings; or for higher risk vs all/low risk participants. None of the studies reported harms related to MI. The results of this review indicate that there are no substantive, meaningful benefits of MI interventions for preventing alcohol use, misuse or alcohol-related problems. Although we found some statistically significant effects, the effect sizes were too small, given the measurement scales used in the included studies, to be of relevance to policy or practice. Moreover, the statistically significant effects are not consistent for all misuse measures, and the quality of evidence is not strong, implying that any effects could be inflated by risk of bias.","We found a total of 84 randomised controlled trials (studies where participants were randomly divided into one of two or more treatment or control groups) that compared MI with either no intervention or with a different approach. Seventy of these trials focused on higher risk individuals or settings. We were mainly interested in trials with a follow-up period of 4 or more months, and the typical follow-up period was 12 months. We also evaluated the quality of the studies' designs and their applicability to our research, finding that these studies provided moderate to low quality evidence. In 66 trials, the MI consisted of a single, individual session. In 12 studies, young people attended multiple individual sessions or mixtures of both individual sessions and group sessions. Six trials used group MI sessions only. The length of MI sessions varied, but in 57 studies it was one hour or less. The shortest MI intervention was 10 to 15 minutes, and the longest had five dedicated MI sessions over a 19-hour period. Settings for the trials varied: 58 of the 84 studies took place in college (mainly university but also four vocational) settings. The remaining trials took place in healthcare locations, a youth centre, local companies, a job-related training centre, an army recruitment setting, UK drug agencies and youth prisons. The total number of young adults was 22,872, aged on average from 15 to 24 years old. The proportion of males in the trials with both males and females ranged from 22% to 90%. The ethnicity of the young adults was typically mixed, but 52 of the 67 studies that reported ethnicity involved mostly white people. At four or more months follow-up, we found only small or borderline effects showing that MI reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed, frequency of alcohol consumption, alcohol problems and peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC). We didn't find any effects for binge drinking, average BAC, drink-driving or other alcohol-related risky behaviour. We found no relationship between the length of MI and its effectiveness. Also, there were no clear subgroup differences in effects when we examined the type of comparison group (assessment only control or alternative intervention, the setting (college/university vs other settings), or risk status (higher risk students vs all/low-risk students). None of the studies reported harms related to MI. Although we found some significant effects for MI, our reading of these results is that the strength of the effects was slight and therefore unlikely to confer any advantage in practice. Overall, there is only low or moderate quality evidence for the effects found in this review. Many of the studies did not adequately describe how young people were allocated to the study groups or how they concealed the group allocation to participants and personnel. Study drop-outs were also an issue in many studies. These problems with study quality could result in inflated estimates of MI effects, so we cannot rule out the possibility that any slight effects observed in this review are overstated. The US National Institutes of Health provided funding for half (42/84) of the studies included in this review. Twenty-nine studies provided no information about funding, and only eight papers had a clear conflict of interest statement."
CD006100,"Eight trials, generating 10 treatment-control comparisons, that recruited 1470 adults and 470 children met the entry criteria. These studies were of mixed quality, and there was heterogeneity in the severity of asthma exacerbation. For oral treatment, there was no significant difference in hospital admission between LTRAs and control in three trials on 194 children (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 3.52). Using a broader composite outcome which measured requirement for additional care there was no significant difference between treatments (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.28). Results demonstrated some indication of improvement in lung function with a significant difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) favouring LTRAs in two trials on 641 adults (mean difference (MD) 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14). There were insufficient data to assess this outcome in children. The most common adverse event described was headache; however, there was no significant difference between LTRAs and control (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.22 to 2.99). Due to insufficient numbers, we were unable to conduct a subgroup analysis based on age. The combined results of two trials of intravenous treatment in 772 adults and one trial in 276 children demonstrated a reduction in the risk of hospital admission which was not quite statistically significant (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01). There was a statistically significant small difference in FEV1 in the adult studies (MD 0.12; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.17), but not in the single trial in children (MD 0.01; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08). Presently, the available evidence does not support routine use of oral LTRAs in acute asthma. Further studies are required to assess whether intravenous treatment can reduce the risk of hospital admission, and what the most appropriate dose regimen is. Additional research is also needed into safety and efficacy of additional doses for those on maintenance therapy, and larger paediatric trials are required to allow subgroup analysis. Prolonged studies would be required to establish other health economic outcomes in admitted patients.","This review considers the effect of antileukotriene agents, (normally used as add-on preventer therapy in chronic asthma), when used during acute asthma treated in emergency settings. We identified eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 1470 adults and 470 children addressing this question, and in most of these studies participants were also given courses of corticosteroids at the time of treatment. We did not find a significant difference in the likelihood of being admitted to hospital between people treated with oral antileukotrienes and placebo or usual care. There was no significant difference in participants requiring additional care (including hospital admission or other treatment options) at the end of the studies between treatment and control groups. There was an improvement in lung function in people taking antileukotrienes compared to those on placebo. More research in this area is required, and the low number of studies recruiting children does not enable us to provide evidence on what effects this class of drugs has in children. There were two trials that randomised 772 adults and 276 children to receive intravenous antileukotrienes and there was no statistically significant difference in hospital admissions, however there was an improvement in lung function in adults on antileukotrienes."
CD012165,"We included 54 studies involving 2729 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The studies evaluated endometrial biomarkers either in specific phases of the menstrual cycle or outside of it, and the studies tested the biomarkers either in menstrual fluid, in whole endometrial tissue or in separate endometrial components. Twenty-seven studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of 22 endometrial biomarkers for endometriosis. These were angiogenesis and growth factors (PROK-1), cell-adhesion molecules (integrins α3β1, α4β1, β1 and α6), DNA-repair molecules (hTERT), endometrial and mitochondrial proteome, hormonal markers (CYP19, 17βHSD2, ER-α, ER-β), inflammatory markers (IL-1R2), myogenic markers (caldesmon, CALD-1), neural markers (PGP 9.5, VIP, CGRP, SP, NPY, NF) and tumour markers (CA-125). Most of these biomarkers were assessed in single studies, whilst only data for PGP 9.5 and CYP19 were available for meta-analysis. These two biomarkers demonstrated significant diversity for the diagnostic estimates between the studies; however, the data were too limited to reliably determine the sources of heterogeneity. The mean sensitivities and specificities of PGP 9.5 (7 studies, 361 women) were 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.00) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.00), after excluding one outlier study, and for CYP19 (8 studies, 444 women), they were were 0.77 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.85) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 84), respectively. We could not statistically evaluate other biomarkers in a meaningful way. An additional 31 studies evaluated 77 biomarkers that showed no evidence of differences in expression levels between the groups of women with and without endometriosis. We could not statistically evaluate most of the biomarkers assessed in this review in a meaningful way. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Although PGP 9.5 met the criteria for a replacement test, it demonstrated considerable inter study heterogeneity in diagnostic estimates, the source of which could not be determined. Several endometrial biomarkers, such as endometrial proteome, 17βHSD2, IL-1R2, caldesmon and other neural markers (VIP, CGRP, SP, NPY and combination of VIP, PGP 9.5 and SP) showed promising evidence of diagnostic accuracy, but there was insufficient or poor quality evidence for any clinical recommendations. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and using any non-invasive tests should only be undertaken in a research setting. We have also identified a number of biomarkers that demonstrated no diagnostic value for endometriosis. We recommend that researchers direct future studies towards biomarkers with high diagnostic potential in good quality diagnostic studies.","The evidence in this review is current to April 2015. We included 54 studies involving 2729 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive-aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Twenty-six studies evaluated the role of 22 different biomarkers in diagnosing endometriosis, and 31 studies identified 77 additional biomarkers that had no value in differentiating between women with and without the disease. Only two of the assessed biomarkers, a neural fibre marker PGP 9.5 and hormonal marker CYP19, were assessed in sufficient number of studies to obtain meaningful results. PGP 9.5 identified endometriosis with enough accuracy to replace surgical diagnosis. Several additional biomarkers (endometrial proteome, 17βHSD2, IL-1R2, caldesmon and other neural markers) show promise in detecting endometriosis, but there are too few studies to be sure of their diagnostic value. The studies differed in how they were conducted, which groups of women were studied and how the surgery was undertaken. The reports were of low methodological quality, which is why readers cannot consider these results to be reliable unless confirmed in large, high quality studies. Overall, there is not enough evidence to recommend any endometrial test for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Further high quality research is necessary to accurately evaluate the diagnostic potential of the endometrial biomarkers for the diagnosis of endometriosis."
CD007565,"There were no RCTs or prospective non-RCTs identified that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of surgery when performed as a primary procedure in advanced stage ovarian cancer. We found 11 retrospective studies that included a multivariate analysis that met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease was microscopic that is no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women. PFS was not reported in all of the studies but was sufficiently documented to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. When we compared suboptimal (> 1 cm) versus optimal (< 1 cm) cytoreduction the survival estimates were attenuated but remained statistically significant in favour of the lower volume disease group There was no significant difference in OS and only a borderline difference in PFS when residual disease of > 2 cm and < 2 cm were compared (hazard ratio (HR) 1.65, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.31; and HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, P = 0.05 for OS and PFS respectively). There was a high risk of bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies where, despite statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors, selection bias was still likely to be of particular concern. Adverse events, quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness were not reported by treatment arm or to a satisfactory level in any of the studies. During primary surgery for advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer all attempts should be made to achieve complete cytoreduction. When this is not achievable, the surgical goal should be optimal (< 1 cm) residual disease. Due to the high risk of bias in the current evidence, randomised controlled trials should be performed to determine whether it is the surgical intervention or patient-related and disease-related factors that are associated with the improved survival in these groups of women. The findings of this review that women with residual disease < 1 cm still do better than women with residual disease > 1 cm should prompt the surgical community to retain this category and consider re-defining it as 'near optimal' cytoreduction, reserving the term 'suboptimal' cytoreduction to cases where the residual disease is > 1 cm (optimal/near optimal/suboptimal instead of complete/optimal/suboptimal).","This review assessed overall and progression-free survival of optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV). We found 11 retrospective studies that included more than 100 women and used a multivariate analysis (used statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors) and met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease is microscopic with no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women.

CD002064,"We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of rhIGF-I, involving 779 participants, for inclusion in the analysis. In a European trial (183 participants) the mean difference (MD) in change in AALSRS total score after nine months was -3.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.68 to 2.08). In a North American trial (266 participants), the MD after nine months was -6.00 (95% CI -10.99 to -1.01). The combined analysis from both RCTs showed a MD after nine months of -4.75 (95% CI -8.41 to -1.09), a significant difference in favour of the treated group. The secondary outcome measures showed non-significant trends favouring rhIGF-I. There was an increased risk of injection site reactions with rhIGF-I (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.54). . A second North American trial (330 participants) used a novel primary end point involving manual muscle strength testing. No differences were demonstrated between the treated and placebo groups in this study. All three trials were at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in favour of rhIGF-I treatment; however, the quality of the evidence from the two included trials was low. A third study showed no difference between treatment and placebo. There is no evidence for increase in survival with IGF1. All three included trials were at high risk of bias.","Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 779 participants measured disease progression on special clinical rating scales of disease severity in ALS. The review authors collected data about adverse events from the included trials. The combined results from the two included studies that used the rating scale (AALSRS) showed a small significant benefit in favour of rhIGF-I. Significant flaws in the trial designs make the statistically significant benefits in some outcomes of questionable relevance. There was an increased risk of injection site reactions with rhIGF-I. A third study using a different outcome measure showed no difference between treatment and placebo. Taken together, the available RCTs do not provide information supporting the hypothesis that rhIGF-I is an effective disease modifying treatment for ALS. All three included studies showed a high risk of bias. These issues very seriously detracted from the ability of this review to fulfil its objectives."
CD003623,"We found no randomised clinical trials comparing PAIR versus no or sham intervention. We identified only two randomised clinical trials, one comparing PAIR versus surgical treatment (n = 50 participants) and the other comparing PAIR (with or without albendazole) versus albendazole alone (n = 30 participants). Both trials were graded as 'adequate' for allocation concealment; however, generation of allocation sequence and blinding methods were 'unclear' in both. Compared to surgery, PAIR plus albendazole obtained similar cyst disappearance and mean cyst diameter with fewer adverse events (32% versus 84%, P < 0.001) and fewer days in hospital (mean + SD) ( 4.2 + 1.5 versus 12.7 + 6.5 days, P < 0.001). Compared to albendazole, PAIR with or without albendazole obtained significantly more (P < 0.01) cyst reduction and symptomatic relief. PAIR seems promising, but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute PAIR with or without benzimidazole coverage for treating patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary to address the topic.","Two randomised clinical trials on the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration method for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst were identified. One trial compared puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration with surgical treatment. The other trial compared puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration with or without albendazole with albendazole alone. Both trials had high risk of bias. The number of participants enrolled and the follow-up duration are insufficient for a definite conclusion to be drawn. In general, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration method with or without benzimidazole coverage for patients with uncomplicated hepatic hydatid cyst."
CD010605,"We included 15 trials (1376 participants) in this review. We downgraded the quality of evidence for many of our outcomes on the basis of high risk of bias. Low-quality evidence suggests that immunonutrition decreases all-cause mortality (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.80). The effect of immunonutrition on other outcomes from a subset of the included trials was uncertain. Subgrouping trials by type of enteral nutrition did not explain any variation in effect. We found mainly very low-quality evidence for the effects of probiotics on the main outcomes. One eligible trial in this comparison reported a higher rate of serious adverse events leading to increased organ failure and mortality due to low numbers of events and low risk of bias. When we excluded this study as a post hoc sensitivity analysis, risks of mortality (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.84), organ failure (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92) and local septic complications (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.72) were lower with probiotics. In one trial assessing immunonutrition with probiotics and fibres, no deaths occurred, but hospital stay was shorter with immunonutrition (MD -5.20 days, 95% CI -8.73 to -1.67). No deaths were reported following semi-elemental enteral nutrition (EN), and the effect on length of hospital stay was small (MD 0.30 days, 95% CI -0.82 to 1.42). Fibre-enriched formulations reduced the number of other local complications (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87) and length of hospital stay (MD -9.28 days, 95% CI -13.21 to -5.35) but did not significantly affect all-cause mortality (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.84) and other outcomes. Very low-quality evidence from the subgroup of trials comparing EN versus no intervention showed a decrease in all-cause mortality with EN (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86). We found evidence of low or very low quality for the effects of immunonutrition on efficacy and safety outcomes. The role of supplementation of enteral nutrition with potential immunomodulatory agents remains in question, and further research is required in this area. Studies assessing probiotics yielded inconsistent and almost contrary results, especially regarding safety and adverse events, and their findings do not support the routine use of EN enriched with probiotics in routine clinical practice. However, further research should be carried out to try to determine the potential efficacy or harms of probiotics. Lack of trials reporting on other types of EN assessed and lack of firm evidence regarding their effects suggest that additional randomised clinical trials are needed. The quality of evidence for the effects of any kind of EN on mortality was low, and further studies are likely to have an impact on the finding of improved survival with EN versus no nutritional support. Evidence remains insufficient to support the use of a specific EN formulation.","We included 15 trials with 1376 participants. Two trials included more than two study groups comparing different EN formulations. Six trials compared immunonutrition (EN supplemented with substances potentially able to change the immune response) versus control (other EN, sham treatment (placebo) or no treatment), and six trials investigated EN enriched with probiotics (live bacteria or yeasts that replace or add to helpful bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract). Two trials researched the use of semi-elemental formulations, which are types of EN in which nutrients are broken down to smaller particles. Two trials studied fibre-enriched EN, which may stimulate the growth of intestinal micro-organisms. Only one trial compared immunonutrition enriched with probiotics and fibres versus control. Immunonutrition compared with control showed reduction in all-cause mortality. However, when only specific types of EN were compared, this could not be confirmed. Available evidence does not support the effectiveness of probiotics in AP. One trial that made this comparison reported a higher rate of serious adverse events, and consequently more occurrences of organ failure and higher mortality rate. When this trial was excluded, results showed a decrease in mortality, organ dysfunction and pancreatic infectious complications, but with evidence of low to very low quality. Fibre-enriched formulations had a beneficial effect on decreasing local non-infectious complications and shortening hospitalisation. No effects were confirmed for semi-elemental formulations and immunonutrition enriched with probiotics and fibres. These results are inconclusive because of the paucity of data. Comparison of any kind of EN versus no intervention revealed a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality. Overall, EN was associated with a rather small number of mild adverse events (most often nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhoea, pain relapse and higher serological concentrations of sodium) not requiring cessation of tube feeding. We cannot be certain that EN is safe in this population because the quality of evidence for adverse event outcomes is low. All included trials have been assessed as having high risk of bias, most often because they did not provide enough information for adequate assessment of certain study design characteristics, but also because some clear flaws were noted in the way they were designed and carried out. The quality of the evidence throughout this review is considered to be low to very low primarily because of the relatively small numbers of study participants and events included. Study results may reflect systematic and random errors."
CD007057,"We included one RCT with 34 participants who were randomly assigned to receive IVIg or placebo once daily in addition to azathioprine and prednisolone for remission maintenance. There were no significant differences between adjuvant IVIg and adjuvant placebo in mortality, serious adverse events, time to relapse, open-label rescue therapy, and infection rates. The fall in disease activity score, derived from patient-reported symptoms, was slightly greater in the IVIg group than in the placebo group at one month (MD 2.30; 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 3.48, P < 0.01) and three months (MD 1.80; 95% CI 0.35 to 3.25, P = 0.01). There was a significant increase in total adverse events in the IVIg group (relative risk (RR) 3.50; 95% CI 1.44 to 8.48, P < 0.01). There is insufficient evidence from one RCT that IVIg adjuvant therapy provides a therapeutic advantage compared with the combination of steroids and immunosuppressants for patients with WG. Given the high cost of IVIg (one dose at 2 g/kg for a 70 kg patient = $8,400), it should be limited to treat WG in the context of a well conducted RCT powered to detect patient-relevant outcomes.",We found one small randomized trial in which 34 participants were randomized to receive IVIg or placebo once daily in addition to azathioprine and prednisolone for remission maintenance. This trial did not provide enough evidence to determine if IVIg has an advantage over corticosteroids and immunosuppressants for the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis.
CD005612,"We included 11 randomised controlled trials (3949 participants). Nine trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.72, 9 trials, 2663 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.60; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.64; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12; 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine for seizure freedom (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83). However, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We detected no significant differences in treatment withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse effects, specifically, during either pooled analysis or subgroup analysis. Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, headache and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin than in active control. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We assessed all the studies to be at a high risk of funding bias as they were all sponsored by Pfizer. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach. For people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment was significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, although there were issues with tolerability at higher doses. However, the trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making. This review focused on the use of pregabalin in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of pregabalin when used as monotherapy.","This review examined data from eleven trials, including a total of 3949 participants. Study participants were assigned using a random method to take pregabalin, placebo, or another antiepileptic drug in addition to their usual antiepileptic drugs. Participants taking pregabalin were more than twice as likely to have their seizure frequency reduced by 50% or more during a 12-week treatment period compared to those taking placebo, and were nearly four times more likely to be completely free of seizures. Pregabalin was shown to be effective across a range of doses (150 mg to 600 mg), with increasing effectiveness at higher doses. There was also an increased likelihood of treatment withdrawal with pregabalin. Side effects associated with pregabalin included ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, headache, nausea and weight gain. When we compared pregabalin to three other antiepileptic drugs (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and gabapentin), participants taking pregabalin were more likely to achieve a 50% reduction in seizure frequency than those taking lamotrigine. We found no significant differences between pregabalin and levetiracetam or gabapentin as add-on drugs. We rated all included studies as being at low or unclear risk of bias due to missing information about the methods used to conduct the trial and a suspicion of publication bias. Publication bias can occur when studies that report non-significant findings are not published. We suspected publication bias because the majority of included studies showed significant findings and were sponsored by the same drug company. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the primary outcome of reduction in seizure frequency as low, meaning that we cannot be certain that the finding reported is accurate. However, we rated the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes seizure freedom and treatment withdrawal as moderate, so we can be fairly confident that these results are accurate. There were no data regarding the longer-term effectiveness of pregabalin, and the use of pregabalin in drug-resistant generalised epilepsy, which should be investigated in future studies. The evidence is current to 16 November 2020."
CD007478,"Sixty-one RCTs, involving 11,232 participants, reported 43 different interventions. Trials predominantly included women from outpatient clinics; the mean age range of participants was 20 to 40 years. Twenty-five studies reported baseline severity, and 22 studies included participants with moderate to severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE); duration of CLE was not well reported. Studies were conducted mainly in multi-centre settings. Most often treatment duration was 12 months. Risk of bias was highest for the domain of reporting bias, followed by performance/detection bias. We identified too few studies for meta-analysis for most comparisons. We limited this abstract to main comparisons (all administered orally) and outcomes. We did not identify clinical trials of other commonly used treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, that reported complete or partial clinical response or numbers of clinical flares. Complete clinical response
Studies comparing oral hydroxychloroquine against placebo did not report complete clinical response. Chloroquine may increase complete clinical response at 12 months' follow-up compared with placebo (absence of skin lesions) (risk ratio (RR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 2.61; 1 study, 24 participants; low-quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between methotrexate and chloroquine in complete clinical response (skin rash resolution) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 1 study, 25 participants; low-quality evidence). Methotrexate may be superior to placebo with regard to complete clinical response (absence of malar/discoid rash) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.84; 1 study, 41 participants; low-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be little to no difference between azathioprine and ciclosporin in complete clinical response (malar rash resolution) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.52; 1 study, 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Partial clinical response
Partial clinical response was reported for only one key comparison: hydroxychloroquine may increase partial clinical response at 12 months compared to placebo, but the 95% CI indicates that hydroxychloroquine may make no difference or may decrease response (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16; 20 pregnant participants, 1 trial; low-quality evidence). Clinical flares
Clinical flares were reported for only two key comparisons: hydroxychloroquine is probably superior to placebo at 6 months' follow-up for reducing clinical flares (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 study, 47 participants; moderate-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be no difference between methotrexate and placebo, but the 95% CI indicates there may be more or fewer flares with methotrexate (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.83; 1 study, 86 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events
Data for adverse events were limited and were inconsistently reported, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well-documented adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver problems, and retinopathy for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and teratogenicity during pregnancy for methotrexate. Evidence supports the commonly-used treatment hydroxychloroquine, and there is also evidence supporting chloroquine and methotrexate for treating cutaneous disease in SLE. Evidence is limited due to the small number of studies reporting key outcomes. Evidence for most key outcomes was low or moderate quality, meaning findings should be interpreted with caution. Head-to-head intervention trials designed to detect differences in efficacy between treatments for specific CLE subtypes are needed. Thirteen further trials are awaiting classification and have not yet been incorporated in this review; they may alter the review conclusions.","We searched the medical literature for studies that compared any treatment for skin disease in SLE against:
• a placebo (dummy) treatment;
• no treatment;
• another treatment; or
• a different dose of the same treatment. We compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes and the consistency of findings across studies. We found 61 studies that included 11,232 people (mostly women) and investigated 43 different treatments. Most treatments lasted one year, and people were followed for up to 48 months. Here we report the main findings of our review on the effects of five different oral medicines: hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, methotrexate, ciclosporin, and azathioprine. Disappearance of skin problems
We do not know if hydroxychloroquine is better or worse than placebo at making skin problems disappear because no studies reported information about this. The evidence suggests that:
• chloroquine may be better at making skin problems disappear after 12 months than placebo (1 study, 24 people);
• when we compare methotrexate and choloroquine, there may be little to no difference in how often they make skin rashes disappear after six months (1 study, 25 people);
• methotrexate may be better for making skin rashes disappear after six months than placebo (1 study, 41 people); and
• there may be little to no difference in how often skin problems disappear after 12 months between ciclosporin and aziathropine (1 study, 25 people). Partial disappearance of skin problems (at least 50% improvement in the skin condition)
It is unclear if hydroxycholoroquine is better or worse than placebo at making skin problems disappear at least partially after 12 months. This is because the evidence is too imprecise (1 study, 20 pregnant women). No other studies have examined how treatments affect the partial disappearance of skin problems. Flares
The evidence suggests that after six months, fewer flares probably occur with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (1 study, 47 people). It is unclear if flares are more, or less, likely to occur after 12 months with methotrexate compared to placebo (1 study, 86 people). No other studies have reported information on how treatments affect flares. Adverse events
Evidence is often imprecise, and whether treatments lead to more or fewer adverse events than placebo or other treatments is not clear. We found limited data for adverse events, and reports were discrepant, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well-known adverse effects including stomach and liver problems. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause eye problems, and methotrexate can cause serious harm to a developing baby if taken during pregnancy. Other outcomes
We do not know how treatments affect other aspects of disease severity or quality of life. This is because studies did not report information on this. When compared against a placebo, studies in people with SLE show that:
• fewer flares probably occur with hydroxychloroquine; and
• methotrexate and chloroquine may be better at making skin problems disappear. Information about adverse effects is limited. The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2019."
CD006954,"Twenty studies (1150 women) were included. Women who had caesarean section performed under regional analgesia and had wound infiltration had a decrease in morphine consumption at 24 hours (SMD -1.70mg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75 to -0.94) compared to placebo. In women under general anaesthesia, with caesarean section wound infiltration and peritoneal spraying with local anaesthetic (one study, 100 participants), the need for opioid rescue was reduced (risk ratio (RR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69). The numerical pain score (0 to10) within the first hour was also reduced (mean difference (MD) -1.46; 95% CI -2.60 to -0.32). Women with regional analgesia who had local anaesthetic and non-steriodal anti-inflammatory cocktail wound infiltration consumed less morphine (one study, 60 participants; MD -7.40 mg; 95% CI -9.58 to -5.22) compared to local anaesthetic control. Women who had regional analgesia with abdominal nerves blocked had decreased opioid consumption (four studies, 175 participants; MD -25.80 mg; 95% CI -50.39 to -5.37). For the outcome of visual analogue scale 0 to 10 over 24 hours, no advantage was demonstrated in the single study of 50 participants who had wound infiltrated with a mixture of local analgesia and narcotics versus local analgesia. Addition of ketamine to the local analgesia in women who had regional analgesia does not confer any advantage. Local analgesia infiltration and abdominal nerve blocks as adjuncts to regional analgesia and general anaesthesia are of benefit in caesarean section by reducing opioid consumption. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an adjuvant may confer additional pain relief.","The authors identified twenty randomised controlled trials of sufficient quality involving 1150 women. These trials were carried out in both developed and developing countries. In general, local anaesthesia wound infiltration was of benefit in women having a caesarean section requiring regional anaesthetics because of a reduction in the use of opioid analgesia. Women undergoing general anaesthesia who had wound infiltration with local anaesthetics and peritoneal spraying required lower amounts of opioids in the first 24 hours post-operation compared to saline control. Those who had a general anaesthetic and the abdominal wall nerves blocked had reduced pain scores within the first 24 hours postoperative. Women who had regional anaesthesia and abdominal nerves blocked also benefited by decrease in opioid requirements. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided additional pain relief but with more side effects of pruritus. The commonly used local anaesthetic agents do have side effects but these are very rare, ranging from allergy to cardiovascular and central nervous system effects. There was no report of side effects in infants following local anaesthetic infiltration but the number of women studied was small. The longer theatre time and cost of the local anaesthetic may be offset by less use of postoperative analgesia. The effect on the development of chronic pelvic pain should be an important area of research."
CD008226,"In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40). This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.","This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012 (Adams 2012). Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that is prescribed to prevent adverse cardiovascular events and to lower blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. It is therefore important to know the magnitude of the effect that atorvastatin has on cholesterol. We searched for all evidence obtained from three- to 12-week trials reporting the effect of atorvastatin on blood cholesterol. This update found 42 additional trials and reports on 296 trials in 38,817 participants. Atorvastatin showed a consistent effect in lowering blood cholesterol over the dose range of 2.5 to 80 mg daily. The effect was greater with higher doses than with lower doses. Atorvastatin works similarly to rosuvastatin in lowering cholesterol but is about three-fold less potent. Risk of bias for all assessed trials was high. Review authors were unable to assess harms of atorvastatin because the included trials were too short, and because only 34 included trials assessed harms."
CD001770,"We found 16 small RCTs (fewer than 100 patients enrolled) and 2 larger RCTs (more than 100 patients enrolled). These 18 studies looked at a total of 916 patients treated with a total of 12 different pharmaceutical agents. Overall methodology of the studies was poor, in part because of ethical dilemmas such as giving placebo injections to children. Two studies showed that placebo was not as good as active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence suggested that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than does vigabatrin. Responses without subsequent relapse may be no different. The same study suggests that hormonal treatments might improve the long-term developmental outcome compared with vigabatrin in infants not found to have an underlying cause for their infantile spasms. To date, few well-designed RCTs have considered the treatment of infantile spasms, and the numbers of patients enrolled have been small. In the majority, methodology has been poor, hence it is not clear which treatment is optimal in the treatment of this epilepsy syndrome. Hormonal treatment resolves spasms in more infants than vigabatrin, but this may or may not translate into better long-term outcomes. If prednisolone or vigabatrin is used, high dosage is recommended. Vigabatrin may be the treatment of choice in tuberous sclerosis. Resolution of the EEG features may be important, but this has not been proven. Further research using large studies with robust methodology is required.","The optimum treatment for infantile spasms has yet to be proven with confidence, in part because of the different aims of existing studies. However, some useful conclusions can be drawn from current evidence. Infantile spasms is a rare seizure disorder commonly associated with severe learning difficulties. Many different treatments are currently used worldwide in the treatment of this disorder, and many more have been tried in the past, often with little success. Not all treatments are licensed for use in all countries. Most treatments are associated with significant adverse effects. Additional research is needed to explore the long-term benefits of different therapies for seizure control and for neurodevelopment. Two studies have shown that a placebo is not as good as an active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence suggests that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than does vigabatrin. Responses without subsequent relapse may be no different, but one study suggested that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide) might improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and young children for whom no underlying cause for their infantile spasms has been identified. This makes hormonal treatment more attractive, at least for this group of infants. More information and further research are needed to compare currently available therapies."
CD004622,"We included 20 RCTs, with 944 participants, in this updated review. No studies assessed the primary outcome tooth loss. Thirteen trials compared full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hours without the use of antiseptic (FMS) versus control, 13 trials compared full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hours with adjunctive use of an antiseptic (FMD) versus control, and six trials compared FMS with FMD. Of the 13 trials comparing FMS versus control, we assessed three at high risk of bias, six at low risk of bias and four at unclear risk of bias. We assessed our certainty about the evidence as low or very low for the outcomes in this comparison. There was no evidence for a benefit for FMS over control for change in PPD, gain in CAL or reduction in BOP at six to eight months (PPD: mean difference (MD) 0.03 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) –0.14 to 0.20; 5 trials, 148 participants; CAL: MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.26; 5 trials, 148 participants; BOP: MD 2.64%, 95% CI –8.81 to 14.09; 3 trials, 80 participants). There was evidence of heterogeneity for BOP (I² = 50%), but none for PPD and CAL. Of the 13 trials comparing FMD versus control, we judged four at high risk of bias, one at low risk of bias and eight at unclear risk of bias. At six to eight months, there was no evidence for a benefit for FMD over control for change in PPD or CAL (PPD: MD 0.11 mm, 95% CI –0.04 to 0.27; 6 trials, 224 participants; low-certainty evidence; CAL: 0.07 mm, 95% CI –0.11 to 0.24; 6 trials, 224 participants; low-certainty evidence). The analyses found no evidence of a benefit for FMD over control for BOP (very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of heterogeneity for PPD or CAL, but considerable evidence of heterogeneity for BOP, attributed to one study. There were no consistent differences in these outcomes between intervention and control (low- to very low-certainty evidence). Of the six trials comparing FMS and FMD, we judged two trials at high risk of bias, one at low risk of bias and three as unclear. At six to eight months, there was no evidence of a benefit of FMD over FMS for change in PPD or gain in CAL (PPD: MD –0.11 mm, 95% CI –0.30 to 0.07; P = 0.22; 4 trials, 112 participants; low-certainty evidence; CAL: MD –0.05 mm, 95% CI –0.23 to –0.13; P = 0.58; 4 trials, 112 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between FMS and FMD for BOP at any time point (P = 0.98; 2 trials, 22 participants; low- to very low-certainty evidence). There was evidence of heterogeneity for BOP (I² = 52%), but not for PPD or CAL. Thirteen studies predefined adverse events as an outcome; three reported an event after FMD or FMS. The most important harm identified was an increase in body temperature. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for most comparisons and outcomes as low because of design limitations leading to risk of bias, and the small number of trials and participants, leading to imprecision in the effect estimates. The inclusion of nine new RCTs in this updated review has not changed the conclusions of the previous version of the review. There is still no clear evidence that FMS or FMD approaches provide additional clinical benefit compared to conventional mechanical treatment for adult periodontitis. In practice, the decision to select one approach to non-surgical periodontal therapy over another should include patient preference and the convenience of the treatment schedule.","The included studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that evaluated a full-mouth approach to subgingival instrumentation, with at least three months of monitoring (follow-up). Both FMS and FMD were compared to conventional quadrant SRP (control). Participants had a clinical diagnosis of chronic periodontitis and we excluded studies of people with aggressive periodontitis, systemic disorders (affecting other part of the body) or who were taking antibiotics. We included nine new studies in this update and we excluded one trial that had been included in the previous version of the review. In total, the review now includes 20 studies that involved 944 participants. Treatment effects of FMS and FMD are modest and there are no clear implications for periodontal care. Neither treatment was superior to the usual treatment of scaling and root planing a quarter of the mouth at a time. The most important harm identified was an increased body temperature after FMS or FMD treatments, reported in three out of 13 studies. In practice, the decision to select one approach over another will be based on preference and convenience for patient and dentist. Our confidence in the results is low for most comparisons and outcomes, due to the small number of studies and participants involved, and limitations in study designs. The addition of nine studies has not changed the findings of our previous version of this review."
CD004572,"Thirty-two randomized controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Many had significant methodological flaws. Change in neurological function, our primary outcome measure, was assessed in 29 trials, but sufficient data for meta-analysis were only available in 13 studies, involving 879 treated participants and 909 controls. There was no overall significant difference between the treated and control groups (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.05), although one subgroup analysis (four trials using tolrestat) favored treatment. A benefit for neuropathic symptoms was suggested by a group of trials using a dichotomized endpoint (improvement or not), but this was contradicted by another group of trials which measured symptoms on a continuous scale. There was no overall benefit on nerve conduction parameters (27 studies) or foot ulceration (one study). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the studies. While most adverse events were infrequent and minor, three compounds had dose limiting adverse events that lead to their withdrawal from human use: severe hypersensitivity reactions with sorbinil, elevation of creatinine with zenarestat, and alteration of liver function with tolrestat. We found no statistically significant difference between aldose reductase inhibitors and placebo in the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. Any future clinical trials of aldose reductase inhibitors should be restricted to compounds proven to have substantial biological or preclinical advantages over previously tested agents.","The authors reviewed the results of all randomized trials that compared an aldose reductase inhibitor with a control and lasted at least six months. Many of the 32 randomized controlled trials identified had significant methodological flaws. The trials used a variety of measures to look for a benefit of treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors. The authors elected to focus primarily on changes in muscle strength and sensation. These were chosen because they are thought be the best indicator of the severity of polyneuropathy, and they have been used in a previous landmark study of the effects of intensive blood sugar control on diabetic neuropathy, as well as in studies of treatments in other types of polyneuropathy. Muscle strength or sensation were assessed in 29 trials, but sufficient data for analysis was only available in 13 studies, involving 879 treated participants and 906 controls. There was no overall significant difference between the treated and control groups. For one drug, tolrestat, there was possibly some benefit, but concerns about liver toxicity have lead to withdrawal of tolrestat from use in humans. A few trials did report that symptoms of neuropathy improved for the treated group, but this was contradicted by most other trials. No benefit was detected on electromyography (EMG) parameters (27 studies) or foot ulceration (one study). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the studies. Adverse effects were infrequent and were mostly minor, except for severe allergic reactions with sorbinil, impaired kidney function with zenarestat, and alteration of liver function with tolrestat. The authors concluded that there was no significant benefit of treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors for diabetic polyneuropathy."
CD006605,"We reviewed 26 studies with 27 treatment groups that enrolled a total of 4893 participants. Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trial continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids. Opioids were administered orally (number of study treatments groups [abbreviated as ""k""] = 12, n = 3040), transdermally (k = 5, n = 1628), or intrathecally (k = 10, n = 231). Many participants discontinued due to adverse effects (oral: 22.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.3% to 32.8%]; transdermal: 12.1% [95% CI: 4.9% to 27.0%]; intrathecal: 8.9% [95% CI: 4.0% to 26.1%]); or insufficient pain relief (oral: 10.3% [95% CI: 7.6% to 13.9%]; intrathecal: 7.6% [95% CI: 3.7% to 14.8%]; transdermal: 5.8% [95% CI: 4.2% to 7.9%]). Signs of opioid addiction were reported in 0.27% of participants in the studies that reported that outcome. All three modes of administration were associated with clinically significant reductions in pain, but the amount of pain relief varied among studies. Findings regarding quality of life and functional status were inconclusive due to an insufficient quantity of evidence for oral administration studies and inconclusive statistical findings for transdermal and intrathecal administration studies. Many patients discontinue long-term opioid therapy (especially oral opioids) due to adverse events or insufficient pain relief; however, weak evidence suggests that patients who are able to continue opioids long-term experience clinically significant pain relief. Whether quality of life or functioning improves is inconclusive. Many minor adverse events (like nausea and headache) occurred, but serious adverse events, including iatrogenic opioid addiction, were rare.","The findings of this systematic review suggest that proper management of a type of strong painkiller (opioids) in well-selected patients with no history of substance addiction or abuse can lead to long-term pain relief for some patients with a very small (though not zero) risk of developing addiction, abuse, or other serious side effects. However, the evidence supporting these conclusions is weak, and longer-term studies are needed to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment."
CD011810,"We have included four studies, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The studies were poor at concealing allocation of treatment and blinding of outcome assessment. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in global and mental state, specific change in negative symptoms, incidence of movement disorder (dyskinesia), leaving the study early for any reason, and costs. All reported data were short-term (under six months' follow-up). The trials did not report data for the important outcomes of clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in mental state was reported using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). When chlorpromazine was compared with clotiapine the average improvement scores for mental state using the PANSS total was higher in the clotiapine group (1 RCT, N = 31, MD 11.50 95% CI 9.42 to 13.58, very low-quality evidence). The average change scores on the PANSS negative sub-scale were similar between treatment groups (1 RCT, N = 21, MD -0.97 95% CI -2.76 to 0.82, very low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in incidence of dyskinesia (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 3.00 95% CI 0.13 to 71.15, very low-quality evidence). Similar numbers of participants left the study early from each treatment group (3 RCTs, N = 158, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.24 to 1.88, very low-quality evidence). Clinically important changes in global and mental state were not reported. Only one trial reported the average change in overall mental state; results favour clotiapine but these limited data are very difficult to trust due to methodological limitations of the study. The comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine compared to clotiapine on change in global state remains unanswered. Results in this review suggest chlorpromazine and clotiapine cause similar adverse effects, although again, the quality of evidence for this is poor, making firm conclusions difficult.","Cochrane Schizophrenia's Information Specialist ran an electronic search in January 2016, searching their specialised register for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either chlorpromazine or clotiapine. The search identified six reports. We inspected these reports and found four trials, published between 1974 and 2003, randomising 276 participants that could be included in the review. The four included trials were poorly conducted and did not report data for clinically important change in global or mental state, or cost of care. Improvement in overall mental state was reported and participants receiving clotiapine had better improvement scores than those receiving chlorpromazine. However the trials also reported data for improvement in the negative symptoms, no difference between the two treatments was found. Clotiapine did not cause more movement disorders than chlorpromazine, and similar numbers of participants left the trials early. There is some very low-quality evidence that favours clotiapine over chlorpromazine for improving overall mental state. For other outcomes, including adverse effects, there is no evidence of a difference between these two antipsychotics. However these data are very difficult to draw conclusions from, only four small trials provided data and these were poorly conducted. We cannot draw conclusions on the comparative effectiveness of chlorpromazine versus clotiapine from such data."
CD013610,"Two RCTs (77 participants with CF; age range 2 to 20 years; 44 (57%) males) met the inclusion criteria of this review. One study employed an intervention to improve adherence to exercise and the second an intervention to improve adherence to ACT. Both studies measured outcomes at baseline and at three months, but neither study formally assessed our primary outcome of adherence in terms of our planned outcome measures, and results were dependent on self-reported data. Adherence to ACTs
One RCT (43 participants) assessed using specifically-composed music alongside ACTs compared to self-selected or no music (usual care). The ACT process consisted of nebuliser inhalation treatment, ACTs and relaxation or antibiotic nebuliser treatment. We graded all evidence as very low certainty. This study reported adherence to ACTs using the Morisky-Green questionnaire and also participants' perception of treatment time and enjoyment, which may influence adherence (outcome not reported specifically in this review). We are uncertain whether participants who received specifically-composed music may be more likely to adhere at six and 12 weeks compared to those who received usual care, risk ratio (RR) 1.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.86) and RR 1.56 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.40) respectively. There may not be any difference in adherence when comparing specifically-composed music to self-selected music at six weeks, RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.68) or 12 weeks, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.38); or self-selected music to usual care at six weeks, RR 1.44 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.52) or 12 weeks, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.86). The music study also reported the number of respiratory infections requiring hospitalisation at 12 weeks, with no difference seen in the risk of hospitalisation between all groups. Adherence to exercise
One RCT (24 participants) compared the provision of a manual of aerobic exercises, recommended exercise prescription plus two-weekly follow-up phone calls to reinforce exercise practice over a period of three months to verbal instructions for aerobic exercise according to the CF centre's protocol. We graded all evidence as very low certainty. We are uncertain whether an educational intervention leads to more participants in the intervention group undertaking increased regular physical activity at three months (self-report), RR 3.67 (95% CI 1.24 to 10.85), and there was no reported difference between groups in the number undertaking physical activity three times per week or undertaking at least 40 minutes of physical activity. No effect was seen on secondary outcome measures of spirometry, exercise capacity or any CF quality of life domains. This study did not report on the frequency of respiratory infections (hospitalised or not) or adverse events. We are uncertain whether a music-based motivational intervention may increase adherence to ACTs or affect the risk of hospitalisation for a respiratory infection. We are also uncertain whether an educational intervention increases adherence to exercise or reduces the frequency of respiratory infection-related hospital admission. However, these results are largely based on self-reported data and the impact of strategies to improve adherence to ACT and exercise in children and adolescents with stable CF remains inconclusive. Given that adherence to ACT and exercise therapy are fundamental to the clinical management of people with CF, there is an urgent need for well-designed, large-scale clinical trials in this area, which should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use appropriate, validated outcome measures. Studies should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes.","We found only two studies that we could include in our review. One was an educational study to improve adherence to exercise, and the second was a motivational study to increase adherence to chest physiotherapy. In the exercise study (34 participants), those who received a written manual seemed to be more physically active at the end of the study, compared to those who were given verbal advice only, but we are not certain whether this was due to the manual. There were no other differences between groups in terms of quality of life, lung function, or exercise capacity. In the chest physiotherapy study (43 participants), we are uncertain whether listening to specially-composed music during chest physiotherapy leads to more time spent completing treatments. We did not find that listening to music people chose themselves while doing physiotherapy led to completion of more treatment compared to not listening to any music. We did not find any real difference in hospital admissions due to chest infection between any of the groups. In both studies, the groups were very small and there were problems in trial design and reporting. This means that the reliability of the results might be affected. As a result, the evidence for strategies to improve adherence to physiotherapy and adherence to exercise was very uncertain. Whilst these studies suggest that some strategies may be helpful, future research needs to consider ways to accurately measure adherence. In the meantime, physiotherapists treating people with CF should follow local guidelines and national standards of care related to CF and treatment adherence. The evidence is current to 28 March 2023."
CD012294,"We included 13 studies, involving 920 randomised participants. There was considerable heterogeneity among study designs, including the comparator arms (placebo, opioid, another NSAID, or a different regimen of ketorolac), dosing regimens (routes and timing of administration, single versus multiple dose), outcome assessment methods, and types of surgery. Mean study population ages ranged from 356 days to 13.9 years. The majority of studies chose a dose of either 0.5 mg/kg (as a single or multiple dose regimen) or 1 mg/kg (single dose with 0.5 mg/kg for any subsequent doses). One study administered interventions intraoperatively; the remainder administered interventions postoperatively, often after the participant reported moderate to severe pain. There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis for either of our primary outcomes: participants with at least 50% pain relief; or mean postoperative pain intensity. Four studies individually reported statistically significant reductions in pain intensity when comparing ketorolac with placebo, but the studies were small and had various risks of bias, primarily due to incomplete outcome data and small sample sizes. We found limited data available for the secondary outcomes of participants requiring rescue medication and opioid consumption. For the former, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo; 74 of 135 (55%) participants receiving ketorolac required rescue analgesia in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) versus 81 of 127 (64%) receiving placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.00, P = 0.05; 4 studies, 262 participants). For opioid consumption in the PACU, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo (P = 0.61). For the time period zero to four hours after administration of the interventions, participants receiving ketorolac received 1.58 mg less intravenous morphine equivalents than those receiving placebo (95% CI -2.58 mg to -0.57 mg, P = 0.002; 2 studies, 129 participants). However, we are uncertain whether ketorolac has an important effect on opioid consumption, as the data were sparse and the results were inconsistent. Only one study reported data for opioid consumption when comparing ketorolac with an opioid. There were no clear differences between the ketorolac and opioid group at any time point. There were no data assessing this outcome for the comparison of ketorolac with another NSAID. There were insufficient data to allow us to analyze overall adverse event or serious adverse event rates. Although the majority of serious adverse events reported in those receiving ketorolac involved bleeding, the number of events was too low to conclude that bleeding risk was increased in those receiving ketorolac perioperatively. There was not a statistically significant increase in event rates for any specific adverse event, either in pooled analysis or in single studies, when comparing ketorolac and placebo. When comparing ketorolac with opioids or other NSAIDs, there were too few data to make any conclusions regarding event rates. Lastly, withdrawals due to adverse events were vary rare in all groups, reflecting the acute nature of such studies. We assessed the quality of evidence for all outcomes for each comparison (placebo or active) as very low, due to issues with risk of bias in individual studies, imprecision, heterogeneity between studies, and low overall numbers of participants and events. Due to the lack of data for our primary outcomes, and the very low-quality evidence for secondary outcomes, the efficacy and safety of ketorolac in treating postoperative pain in children were both uncertain. The evidence was insufficient to support or reject its use.","In November 2017, we searched for clinical trials where ketorolac was used to treat pain after surgery in children. We found 13 studies, enrolling 920 children, that met our requirements for the review. The studies were quite different in their design, the dose of ketorolac, the timing (during or after surgery) and number of doses given, the type of surgery, and to what ketorolac was compared (either a placebo (a dummy treatment, such as a bag of fluid) or another drug). There was not enough information for a statistical analysis of the assessments in which we were most interested, that is, the number of children with at least 50% pain relief; or the average pain intensity (a measure of a patient's pain that asks the patient to rate how much pain they have, often on a scale of 0 for 'no pain' to 10 for 'worst pain imaginable'). Four studies individually reported that ketorolac was better at reducing pain intensity than placebo, but the studies were small and had various design issues. There was more information for other assessments, such as the number of children who needed rescue medication (additional pain medication that is given if the study medication is not helping the person's pain sufficiently), and how much of this rescue medication was used. Fewer children needed rescue medication in the ketorolac group than those who received placebo, although the result was not statistically different. During the four hours after they received study medications, children receiving ketorolac needed slightly less rescue pain medication than those who had received placebo. There was not enough information about ketorolac in direct comparisons with other medications. There was also not enough information in the studies for us to make a good assessment of side effects and serious side effects when ketorolac was used in this setting. Serious side effects in those receiving ketorolac included bleeding, but it didn't occur often enough for us to make any firm conclusions. Very few children dropped out of the studies because of side effects. This is normal in studies where participants are only in the study for a short period of time. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, due to methodological issues with many of the studies, differences in study designs, and low overall numbers of children enrolled. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results."
CD009120,"Six open-label studies (257 patients) were identified. One study compared ACEi with other antihypertensive drugs, three compared ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs, and two studies compared an ARB with an ACEi. Long-term use (≥ 12 months) of an ARB showed significantly benefit of preserving residual kidney function in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients (MD 1.11 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 0.38 to 1.83), although there was no significant benefit when an ARB were used short-term (≤ six months). One study showed that compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use (12 months) of the ACEi ramipril showed a significant reduction in the decline of residual kidney function in patients on CAPD (MD -0.93 mL/min/1.73m², 95% CI -0.75 to -0.11), and delayed the progression to complete anuria (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99). There was no significant difference in serum potassium, urinary protein excretion, Kt/V, weekly creatinine clearance and blood pressure for ARBs versus other antihypertensive drugs. Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, ramipril showed no difference in mortality and cardiovascular events. Compared with an ACEi, ARBs did not show any difference in residual kidney function. The selection bias assessment was low in four studies and unclear in two. Five studies were open-label; however the primary outcome (residual kidney function) was obtained objectively from laboratory tests, and were not likely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. Reporting bias was unclear in all six studies. Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use (≥ 12 months) of ACEis or ARBs showed additional benefits of preserving residual kidney function in CAPD patients. There was no significant difference on residual kidney function preservation between ARBs and ACEis. However, limited by the small number of RCTs enrolling small number of participants, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of an ACEi or an ARB as first line antihypertensive therapy in PD patients.","However studies have focused on heart protection rather than residual kidney function. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of ACEis and ARBs therapy for preserving residual kidney function in PD patients. Six studies (257 patients) were included (three ARB studies, one ACEi study and ACEi versus ARB studies). Long-term use (12 months or more) of an ARB showed a significant benefit in preserving residual kidney function in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs, although there was no significant benefit when an ARB were used for less than six months). One study showed that compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use of the ACEi ramipril showed a significant reduction in the decline of residual kidney function in patients on CAPD as well as anuria rate. While dizziness and cough are the main adverse events when an ACEi is used, only one study comparing an ARB with an ACEi reported this outcome and no significant difference between the two groups were found. While the use of an ARB or an ACEi may both be useful in preserving residual kidney function, the small number of studies and small number of patients enrolled means there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of an ACEi or an ARB as first line antihypertensive therapy in PD patients."
CD012726,"We included six studies with 962 participants assessing the effects of standard valves compared to anti-syphon valves, other types of standard valves, self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves and external differential programmable pressure valves. All included studies started in a hospital setting and offered ambulatory follow-up. Most studies were conducted in infants or children with hydrocephalus from diverse causes. The certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was low to very low. 1. Standard valve versus anti-syphon valve
Three studies with 296 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with standard valve and anti-syphon valves (very low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and anti-syphon valves (range 0 to 2.9%) (low certainty of the evidence). Mortality may be similar in those with standard valves (0%) and anti-syphon valves (0.9%) (RD 0.01%, 95% CI -0.02% to 0.03%, low certainty of the evidence). Ventricular size and head circumference may be similar in those with standard valves and anti-syphon valves (low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported the quality of life of participants. 2. Comparison between different types of standard valves
Two studies with 174 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with different types of standard valves (early postoperative period: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.27; at 12 months follow-up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92, very low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported adverse events beyond those included under ""treatment failure"". We are uncertain about the effects of different types of standard valves on mortality (range 2% to 17%, very low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 3. Standard valve versus self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valve
One study with 229 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with standard valves (42.98%) and self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (39.13%) (low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and those with self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (range 0 to 7.2%) (low certainty of the evidence). The included study reported no deaths in either group in the postoperative period. Beyond the early postoperative period, the authors stated that nine patients died (no disaggregated data by each type of intervention was available, low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 4. External differential programmable pressure valve versus non-programmable valve
One study with 377 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with programmable valves (52%) and non-programmable valves (52%)  (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24, low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with programmable valves (6.19%) and non-programmable valves (6.01%) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.15, low certainty of the evidence). The included study did not report the effect of these interventions on mortality, quality of life or head circumference. Ventricular size reduction may be similar in those with programmable valves and non-programmable valves (low certainty of the evidence). Standard shunt valves for hydrocephalus compared to anti-syphon or self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves may cause little to no difference on the main outcomes of this review, however we are very uncertain due to the low to very low certainty of evidence. Similarly, different types of standard valves and external differential programmable pressure valves versus non-programmable valves may be associated with similar outcomes. Nevertheless, this review did not include valves with the latest technology, for which we need high-quality randomised controlled trials focusing on patient-important outcomes including costs.","We searched for the evidence up to February 2020. We included six studies with 962 participants evaluating: anti-syphon valves, different types of standard valves, self-adjusting cerebrospinal fluid flow-regulating valves and programmable valves. Most of the studies included children with hydrocephalus with a follow-up between two to six years. Four studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by the manufacturer of the device and another study was funded by a foundation. We are uncertain about the differences in treatment failure between standard valves and anti-syphon valves, however, the incidence of adverse events, mortality, ventricular size and head circumference may be similar. None of the included studies reported the quality of life of participants. We are uncertain about the differences in treatment failure and mortality in participants with different types of standard valves. The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size and head circumference. The incidence of treatment failure and adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves and self-adjusting cerebrospinal fluid flow-regulating valves. The included study reported no deaths in either group early after the operation; we are uncertain about effects beyond this period. The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. The incidence of treatment failure is probably similar in those with programmable valves and non-programmable valves, and the incidence of adverse events and ventricular size may be also similar. The included study did not report the effect of these interventions on mortality, quality of life or head circumference. The certainty of the evidence was mostly low to very low since the studies were poorly conducted, with a small number of participants. Furthermore, many studies did not report critical outcomes such as mortality."
CD005496,"We included 60 trials with 11,156 infants. Most trials were small (median sample size 145 infants). The main potential sources of bias were unclear reporting of methods for concealing allocation and masking caregivers or investigators in about half of the trials. The formulation of the probiotics varied across trials. The most common preparations contained Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Saccharomyces spp., andStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Very preterm or very low birth weight infants
Probiotics may reduce the risk of NEC (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.65; I² = 17%; 57 trials, 10,918 infants; low certainty). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 33 (95% CI 25 to 50). Probiotics probably reduce mortality slightly (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; I² = 0%; 54 trials, 10,484 infants; moderate certainty); the NNTB was 50 (95% CI 50 to 100). Probiotics probably have little or no effect on the risk of late-onset invasive infection (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; I² = 22%; 49 trials, 9876 infants; moderate certainty). Probiotics may have little or no effect on neurodevelopmental impairment (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.26; I² = 0%; 5 trials, 1518 infants; low certainty). Extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight infants
Few data were available for extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. In this population, probiotics may have little or no effect on NEC (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22, I² = 0%; 10 trials, 1836 infants; low certainty), all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18; I² = 0%; 7 trials, 1723 infants; low certainty), or late-onset invasive infection (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.09; I² = 0%; 7 trials, 1533 infants; low certainty). No trials provided data for measures of neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm or ELBW infants. Given the low to moderate certainty of evidence for the effects of probiotic supplements on the risk of NEC and associated morbidity and mortality for very preterm or VLBW infants, and particularly for extremely preterm or ELBW infants, there is a need for further large, high-quality trials to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform policy and practice.","One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add probiotics (dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacteria or yeasts) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether probiotic supplementation might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Specifically, we wanted to know if probiotic supplementation was better than placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment for improving:
• necrotising enterocolitis;
• death from any cause;
• serious infection;
• duration of hospitalisation from birth; and
• neurodevelopmental disability. We searched several important databases to identify randomised controlled trials (trials that assign participants to one of two or more treatment groups at random) that investigated the use of probiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 60 trials with 11,156 infants. Most trials were small and had design flaws that might have biased their findings. Giving very preterm and very low birth weight infants probiotics, compared with giving them placebo or no treatment, may reduce their risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and probably reduces their risk of death. Probiotics probably have little or no effect on serious infection and may have little or no effect on disability or developmental outcomes. Probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment may have little or no effect on necrotising enterocolitis, death, or serious infection in extremely preterm infants (those born more than 12 weeks early) or extremely low birth weight infants (those weighing less than 1.0 kg at birth). The methods used in the included trials may have exaggerated the benefits of giving probiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Furthermore, the effect could have been biased by small trials with unreliable methods. Because we have little confidence or moderate confidence in the evidence for the effects of probiotic supplements in very preterm or very low birth weight infants, there is a need for additional large, high-quality trials to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform policy and practice. The evidence is up to date to July 2022."
CD008034,"Three eligible trials involving 569 patients were identified. Due to methodological limitations in the included studies, there was considerable variation in the results of acute (risk range 38.67% to 96.51%) and chronic pain (risk range 7.83% to 40.47%) across the control groups. Therefore, meta-analysis was not performed but the results of the outcomes in the individual trials were compared. Two trials involving 322 patients reported less chronic pain after preperitoneal repair (relative risk (RR) 0.18, number needed to treat (NNT) 8; RR 0.51, NNT 5), whereas one trial, including 247 patients, described more chronic pain after this repair (RR 1.17, NNT 77). The same trials favoured the preperitoneal technique concerning acute pain (RR 0.17, NNT 3; RR 0.78, NNT 7), whereas in the third trial it was almost omnipresent and thus comparable in both intervention arms (RR 0.997, NNT 333). Early and late hernia recurrence rates were similar across the studies, whereas contrasting results were reported for other early outcomes as infection and hematoma. No late mesh infection occurred in the included trials. Both techniques are valid as they result in similar low recurrence rates. Evaluation of pain results in the individual trials shows some evidence that preperitoneal repair causes less or comparable acute and chronic pain compared to the Lichtenstein procedure. We emphasize the need for homogeneous high quality randomized trials comparing elective preperitoneal inguinal hernia techniques and Lichtenstein repair in terms of chronic pain.","The review authors identified three eligible controlled trials in which 569 patients were randomized to Lichtenstein or preperitoneal mesh repair. Due to methodological limitations in the included trials, the data were not pooled. Comparison of pain results in the individual trials showed that preperitoneal repair causes less chronic pain (relative risk (RR) 0.18, number needed to treat (NNT) 8; RR 0.51, NNT 5) compared to the Lichtenstein procedure in two trials involving 322 patients. One trial, including 247 patients, described more chronic pain after this repair (RR 1.17, NNT 77). The same trials favoured the preperitoneal technique concerning acute pain (RR 0.17, NNT 3; RR 0.78, NNT 7), whereas in the third trial it was almost omnipresent and thus comparable in both intervention arms (RR 0.997, NNT 333). This method also showed similar low recurrence rates after both types of repair. The results for other early complications were not consistent across the included trials. No mesh infections were reported. In conclusion, both techniques are valid causing few recurrences. Analysis of pain results in each trial shows some evidence that preperitoneal repair causes less or comparable acute and chronic pain compared to the Lichtenstein technique. As no robust conclusions concerning chronic pain after elective hernia surgery can be made, we highlight the need for homogeneous trials."
CD006202,"We included 71 trials in the review with 26 studies (1398 participants) comparing a bleaching agent to placebo and 51 studies (2382 participants) comparing a bleaching agent to another bleaching agent. Two studies were at low overall risk of bias; two at high overall risk of bias; and the remaining 67 at unclear overall risk of bias. The bleaching agents (carbamide peroxide (CP) gel in tray, hydrogen peroxide (HP) gel in tray, HP strips, CP paint-on gel, HP paint-on gel, sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) chewing gum, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) chewing gum, and HP mouthwash) at different concentrations with varying application times whitened teeth compared to placebo over a short time period (from 2 weeks to 6 months), however the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. In trials comparing one bleaching agent to another, concentrations, application method and application times, and duration of use varied widely. Most of the comparisons were reported in single trials with small sample sizes and event rates and certainty of the evidence was assessed as low to very low. Therefore the evidence currently available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions regarding the superiority of home-based bleaching compositions or any particular method of application or concentration or application time or duration of use. Tooth sensitivity and oral irritation were the most common side effects which were more prevalent with higher concentrations of active agents though the effects were mild and transient. Tooth whitening did not have any effect on oral health-related quality of life. We found low to very low-certainty evidence over short time periods to support the effectiveness of home-based chemically-induced bleaching methods compared to placebo for all the outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of home-based bleaching compositions or any particular method of application or concentration or application time or duration of use, as the overall evidence generated was of very low certainty. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising methods of application, concentrations, application times, and duration of treatment.","Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review of existing studies and the evidence is current up to 12 June 2018. We included 71 trials that involved 3780 adults who underwent tooth whitening procedures with various bleaching agents using different methods of application, length of application and duration of treatment. 26 studies compared a bleaching agent to placebo and 51 studies compared one bleaching agent to another bleaching agent. The bleaching agents whitened teeth compared to placebo over a short time period (from 2 weeks to 6 months), however the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. The evidence currently available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions regarding the superiority of home-based bleaching compositions or any particular method of application or concentration or application time or duration of use. The most common adverse events were tooth sensitivity and oral irritation, which were reported with higher concentrations of active agents, although the effects were mild and transient. Well-planned randomised controlled trials need to be conducted by standardising methods of application, concentrations, application times and duration of treatment. The overall certainty of the evidence was low to very low for all comparisons. This was because most of the comparisons were reported in single trials with small sample sizes and event rates. There was an unclear risk of bias in most of the trials."
CD010673,"We identified three prospective RCTs for inclusion in this review (319 participants available to assess the primary outcome of anxiety). The studies included people from the outpatient setting, with the majority of participants being male. All three studies assessed psychological therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy) plus co-intervention versus co-intervention alone. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to all outcomes as low due to small sample sizes and substantial heterogeneity in the analyses. Two of the three studies had prespecified protocols available for comparison between prespecified methodology and outcomes reported within the final publications. We observed some evidence of improvement in anxiety over 3 to 12 months, as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (range from 0 to 63 points), with psychological therapies performing better than the co-intervention comparator arm (mean difference (MD) -4.41 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.28 to -0.53; P = 0.03). There was however, substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 62%), which limited the ability to draw reliable conclusions. No adverse events were reported. We found only low-quality evidence for the efficacy of psychological therapies among people with COPD with anxiety. Based on the small number of included studies identified and the low quality of the evidence, it is difficult to draw any meaningful and reliable conclusions. No adverse events or harms of psychotherapy intervention were reported. A limitation of this review is that all three included studies recruited participants with both anxiety and depression, not just anxiety, which may confound the results. We downgraded the quality of evidence in the 'Summary of findings' table primarily due to the small sample size of included trials. Larger RCTs evaluating psychological interventions with a minimum 12-month follow-up period are needed to assess long-term efficacy.","This systematic review found three studies with a total of 319 participants with COPD and coexisting anxiety. All three studies assessed psychotherapy (CBT) with a co-intervention, versus the co-intervention alone. There was limited evidence showing some improvements in reduced levels of anxiety and improved quality of life in the psychotherapy group. It is important to note that the overall quality of the evidence was low and hence further research is needed to increase our confidence in this effect. A limitation of this review is that all three included studies recruited participants with both anxiety and depression, not just anxiety, which may confound the results. Further research is needed to establish whether this therapy will reduce hospital admissions and length of hospital stays, as this was not assessed in the current evidence base. Larger studies of longer duration need to be conducted. There are at least two more clinical trials currently ongoing for this question. Once they are published, the evidence from them could increase or decrease our confidence in the findings of this review."
CD007926,"We found six trials (542 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. These trials assessed the effectiveness of hormonal therapy in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer as a single agent, as part of combination therapy and as low versus high dose. All comparisons were restricted to single-trial analyses, where we found no evidence that hormonal therapy as a single agent or as a combination treatment prolonged overall or five-year disease-free survival of women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, low-dose hormonal therapy may have had a benefit in terms of overall and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to high-dose hormonal therapy (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.66 and HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.71 for overall and PFS, respectively). We found insufficient evidence that hormonal treatment in any form, dose or as part of combination therapy improves the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, a large number of patients would be needed to demonstrate an effect on survival and none of the included RCTs had a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate a significant difference. In the absence of a proven survival advantage and the heterogeneity of patient populations, the decision to use any type of hormonal therapy should be individualised and with the intent to palliate the disease. It is debatable whether outcomes such as quality of life, treatment response or palliative measures such as relieving symptoms should take preference over overall and PFS as the major objectives of future trials.","Endometrial cancer is cancer arising from the lining of the womb. Most women with endometrial cancer are diagnosed when their tumour is still confined to the body of the womb. However, about 10% of women with endometrial cancer are diagnosed when the disease is already at an advanced stage. The latter group of patients tend to have much poorer survival. Treatment of women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer is challenging because often they suffer from other diseases and aggressive chemotherapy with or without surgery may not be beneficial or may even be harmful. Hormonal therapy in these cases is thought to be easily administered and to cause fewer side effects than systemic chemotherapy (standard treatment). The purpose of this review was to assess the available literature on the effect of hormonal treatment on the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. We found six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed hormonal treatment in various forms and combinations in 542 eligible patients. We found insufficient evidence to suggest that hormonal therapy improves survival in these patients. The main limitations of the review were the small number of patients included in the RCTs, the diversity of both the patient population and the hormonal agents used and the fact that quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The quality of life with treatment is especially important for a condition that has a poor survival rate."
CD006876,"We included 45 trials (involving 1619 participants) in this update of our review. Electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training improved activities of daily living scores (SMD 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.52, P = 0.0005; I² = 59%; 24 studies, 957 participants, high-quality evidence), arm function (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.46, P < 0.0001, I² = 36%, 41 studies, 1452 participants, high-quality evidence), and arm muscle strength (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77, P = 0.003, I² = 76%, 23 studies, 826 participants, high-quality evidence). Electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training did not increase the risk of participant dropout (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, P = 0.93, I² = 0%, 45 studies, 1619 participants, high-quality evidence), and adverse events were rare. People who receive electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training after stroke might improve their activities of daily living, arm function, and arm muscle strength. However, the results must be interpreted with caution although the quality of the evidence was high, because there were variations between the trials in: the intensity, duration, and amount of training; type of treatment; participant characteristics; and measurements used.","We identified 45 trials (involving 1619 participants) up to January 2018 and included them in our review. Twenty-four different electromechanical devices were described in the trials, which compared electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training with a variety of other interventions. Participants were between 21 to 80 years of age, the duration of the trials ranged from two to 12 weeks, the size of the trials was between eight and 127 participants, and the primary outcome (activities of daily living: the most important target variable measured) differed between the included trials. Electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training improved activities of daily living in people after stroke, and function and muscle strength of the affected arm. As adverse events, such as injuries and pain, were seldom described, these devices can be applied as a rehabilitation tool, but we still do not know when or how often they should be used. The quality of the evidence was high."
CD008407,"This update identified no new trials so the results remain unchanged. However, by applying the GRADE assessment of the evidence, the interpretation of main results differed from previous version of this review. We identified 10 studies involving 2044 women, but all these studies involved either three or four groups, looking at differing drugs or doses. We have only included the 1301 women who were in the paracetamol versus placebo arms of the studies. Of these, five studies (482 women) assessed 500 mg to 650 mg and six studies (797 women) assessed 1000 mg of paracetamol. One study assessed 650 mg and 1000 mg compared with placebo and contributed to both comparisons. We used a random-effects meta-analysis because of the clinical variability among studies. Studies were from the 1970s to the early 1990s, and there was insufficient information to assess the risk of bias adequately, hence the findings need to be interpreted within this context. The certainty of the evidence for the two primary outcomes on which data were available was assessed as low, downgraded for overall unclear risk of bias and for heterogeneity (I² statistic 60% or greater). More women may experience pain relief with paracetamol compared with placebo (average risk ratio (RR) 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.89; 10 trials, 1279 women), and fewer women may need additional pain relief with paracetamol compared with placebo (average RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.55; 8 trials, 1132 women). However, the certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded for unclear overall risk of bias and substantial heterogeneity. One study used the higher dose of paracetamol (1000 mg) and reported maternal drug adverse effects. There may be little or no difference in the incidence of nausea (average RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.66; 1 trial, 232 women; low-certainty evidence), or sleepiness (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.30; 1 trial, 232 women; low-certainty evidence). No other maternal adverse events were reported. None of the studies assessed neonatal drug adverse effects. A single dose of paracetamol may improve perineal pain relief following vaginal birth, and may reduce the need for additional pain relief. Potential adverse effects for both women and neonates were not appropriately assessed. Any further trials should also address the gaps in evidence concerning maternal outcomes such as satisfaction with postnatal care, maternal functioning/well-being (emotional attachment, self-efficacy, competence, autonomy, confidence, self-care, coping skills) and neonatal drug adverse effects.","We found no new studies in this update, so the review still includes 10 studies involving 1301 women. The studies were quite old, ranging from the 1970s to the early 1990s. All the studies looked at perineal pain relief associated with trauma, and no studies where the pain was associated with intact perineum were found. Overall, the evidence was of low quality due to the unclear methodology reported and the variation of findings. Paracetamol may reduce the number of women experiencing pain at four hours after birth (10 trials, 1279 women), and fewer women may need additional pain relief with paracetamol (eight trials, 1132 women). Only one study reported the number of women experiencing nausea (feeling sick) or sleepiness with no clear differences identified. There were no other side effects and none of the studies looked at effects on the babies. Paracetamol is generally effective as painkiller and causes few side effects. This review showed there may be some benefit specifically with a single dose of paracetamol for perineal pain after vaginal birth. Lactating women should be advised about the little information available on the effects of paracetamol in breastfed babies."
CD010909,"Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review. Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years. Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I2 = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I2 = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I2 = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions. Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure). This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids. Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4. Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety. Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.","Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 2313 people. These studies varied in terms of how bad exacerbations had to be for people to be included and in terms of what other treatments were provided before IV MgSO4was given, but almost all trials gave participants at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting medications and steroid tablets or injection. Overall, IV MgSO4 reduced the need for hospital admission compared with placebo (seven fewer per 100 treated; 95% confidence interval two to 13 fewer). Not enough information was available to show whether the reduction in hospital admissions was associated with severity of the asthma exacerbation, or whether it made a difference what other treatments were given. Evidence suggests that IV MgSO4 improved some lung function parameters, but for other measures such as heart rate, variation among study findings reduced our confidence in the results. We did not find a difference between IV MgSO4 and placebo in most other measures (including time spent in the ED, respiratory rate and blood pressure), and adverse events generally were poorly reported. This review showed that IV MgSO4reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with exacerbations of asthma when other first-line medications have not relieved the acute symptoms (i.e. oxygen, inhaled short-acting medications and IV steroids). Evidence for other measures of benefit and safety was limited. Researchers should clearly define the severity of the asthma condition among people in their studies while carefully recording adverse events. This plain language summary is current as of May 2014."
CD002202,"We included nine RCTs recruiting 1104 adults and children with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin Sβºthalassaemia (HbSβºthal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. We judged the quality of the evidence for the first two comparisons below as moderate to low as the studies contributing to these comparisons were mostly large and well-designed (and at low risk of bias); however, the evidence was limited and imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse events, and the results are applicable only to individuals with HbSS and HbSβºthal genotypes. We judged the quality of the evidence for the third and fourth comparisons to be very low due to the limited number of participants, the lack of statistical power (both studies were terminated early with approximately only 20% of their target sample size recruited) and the lack of applicability to all age groups and genotypes. Hydroxyurea versus placebo
Five studies (784 adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) compared hydroxyurea to placebo; four recruited individuals with only severe disease and one recruited individuals with all disease severities. Hydroxyurea probably improves pain alteration (using measures such as pain crisis frequency, duration, intensity, hospital admissions and opoid use) and life-threatening illness, but we found no difference in death rates (10 deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates did not differ by treatment group) (all moderate-quality evidence). Hydroxyurea may improve measures of HbF (low-quality evidence) and probably decreases neutrophil counts (moderate-quality evidence). There were no consistent differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events) (low-quality evidence). There were fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions in the hydroxyurea groups. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusion and chelation
Two studies (254 children with HbSS or HbSβºthal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) contributed to this comparison. There were no consistent differences in terms of pain alteration, death or adverse events (low-quality evidence) or life-threatening illness (moderate-quality evidence). Hydroxyurea with phlebotomy probably increased HbF and decreased neutrophil counts (moderate-quality evidence), but there were more occurrences of acute chest syndrome and infections. Quality of life was not reported. In the primary prevention study, no strokes occurred in either treatment group but in the secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group) and the study was terminated early. Hydroxyurea versus observation
One study (22 children with HbSS or HbSβºthal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to observation. Pain alteration and quality of life were not reported. There were no differences in life-threatening illness, death (no deaths reported in either group) or adverse events (very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if hydroxyurea improves HbF or decreases neutrophil counts (very low-quality evidence). Treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea
One study (44 adults and children with HbSC) compared treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea. Pain alteration, life-threatening illness and quality of life were not reported. There were no differences in death rates (no deaths reported in either group), adverse events or neutrophil levels (very low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if hydroxyurea improves HbF (very low-quality evidence). There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea may be effective in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or HbSβºthal genotypes and in preventing life-threatening neurological events in those with sickle cell anaemia at risk of primary stroke by maintaining transcranial Doppler velocities. However, there is still insufficient evidence on the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly with regard to preventing chronic complications of SCD, or recommending a standard dose or dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose. There is also insufficient evidence about the long-term risks of hydroxyurea, including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Evidence is also limited on the effects of hydroxyurea on individuals with the HbSC genotype. Future studies should be designed to address such uncertainties.","We included nine randomised studies (1104 adults and children with SCD (HbSS, HbSC or HbSβºthal genotypes)). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. In five studies, 784 adults and children with SCD were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. In two studies, 254 children with SCD, who were also at an increased risk of having a first or second stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (collection of blood) or blood transfusion and chelation (administration of agents to remove excess iron from the body). These seven studies only recruited people with HbSS or HbSβºthal genotypes so the results do not apply to people with the HbSC genotype. There was moderate-quality evidence from these seven studies that hydroxyurea may reduce the frequency of pain crises, may increase HbF and may decrease neutrophil (white blood cell) counts compared to the comparator treatment. We found no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse effects (including serious and life-threatening effects). However, there is less information about these outcomes in the studies, so the quality of this evidence is low. Two further studies were included in the review. In one study, 22 children with SCD, who were also at increased risk of having a stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or no treatment (observation only) and in one study 44 adults and children were randomly selected to receive treatments with or without adding hydroxyurea. In both studies we are unsure if hydroxyurea led to an increase in HbF compared to the comparator treatment. There were no deaths during the studies. There was no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of pain crises and adverse effects (including serious or life-threatening effects) and neither study measured quality of life. The quality of the evidence from these studies is very low, given the studies were very small and only recruited around 20% of the intended number of people, and the results do not apply to all people with SCD (different genotypes). The evidence shows that hydroxyurea is likely to be effective in the short term at decreasing the frequency of painful episodes and raising HbF levels in the blood in people with SCD. Hydroxyurea is also likely to be effective in preventing first strokes for those at an increased risk of stroke and does not seem to be associated with an increase in any adverse effects (including serious and life-threatening effects). There is currently little evidence from the studies that we examined on whether hydroxyurea is beneficial over a long period of time, what the best dose to take is, or whether treatment causes any long-term or serious side effects. More studies are needed to answer these questions."
CD009604,"Our search identified 15,902 records after removal of duplicates. We included 16 studies with 20,512 participants (18,410 participants after adjusting for clustering effects). They were all carried out in upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries. Three studies were controlled before-after studies, one was non-randomised trial, and 12 were RCTs (including three cluster RCTs). Six studies took place in schools; seven in communities; and one each in a nursery/kindergarten, tea estate, and factory. Three studies involved only women, one study involved both women and their children, and all other studies focused on children and/or adolescents. Nine studies used salt as a vehicle for iron fortification, three used fish sauce, two used soy sauce, one used curry powder, and one a ""seasoning powder"". The dose of iron received by participants ranged from 4.4 mg to 55 mg/day. The sample sizes in the trials ranged from 123 to 14,398, and study durations ranged from three months to two years. Twelve RCTs contributed data for meta-analysis. Six trials compared iron-fortified condiments versus the unfortified condiment, and six trials provided data comparing iron fortification in combination with other micronutrients versus the same condiment with other micronutrients, but no added iron. In one trial, the fortificant contained micronutrients that may have affected the absorption of iron. Overall no studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias. All included studies were assessed to have a high overall risk of bias, with the most concerns being around allocation concealment, blinding, and random sequence generation. There was very high heterogeneity amongst studies in almost all examined outcomes. Condiments/seasonings fortified with iron versus unfortified condiments/seasonings
We are uncertain about whether consuming condiments/seasonings fortified with iron in comparison to the same unfortified condiment reduces anaemia at the end of intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.65; 2328 participants; 4 studies; very low-certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about whether consuming iron-fortified condiments increases haemoglobin concentrations (mean difference (MD) 6.40 (g/L), 95% CI -0.62 to 13.41; 2808 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Fortification of condiments/seasonings with iron probably slightly reduces ID (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.01; 391 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about whether fortification with iron increases ferritin concentration (MD 14.81 (µg/L), 95% CI 5.14 to 24.48; 4459 participants; 6 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Condiments/seasonings fortified with iron plus other micronutrients versus condiments/seasonings fortified with other micronutrients except iron
Consuming condiments/seasonings fortified with iron plus other micronutrients may reduce anaemia (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89; 1007 participants; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about whether fortification of condiments/seasonings with iron plus other micronutrients will improve haemoglobin concentration (MD 6.22 g/dL, 95% CI 1.60 to 10.83; 1270 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence). It may reduce ID (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; 1154 participants; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about whether fortification with iron plus other micronutrients improves ferritin concentration (MD 10.63 µg/L, 95% CI 2.40 to 18.85; 1251 participants; 5 studies; very low -certainty evidence). Condiments/seasonings fortified with iron versus no intervention
No trial reported data on this comparison. No studies reported adverse effects. Funding sources do not appear to have distorted the results in any of the assessed trials. We are uncertain whether consuming iron-fortified condiments/seasonings reduces anaemia, improves haemoglobin concentration, or improves ferritin concentration. It may reduce ID. Findings about ferritin should be interpreted with caution since its concentrations increase during inflammation. Consuming condiments/seasonings fortified with iron plus other micronutrients may reduce anaemia, and we are uncertain whether this will improve haemoglobin concentration or ferritin concentration. More studies are needed to determine the true effect of iron-fortified condiments/seasonings on preventing anaemia and improving health. The effects of this intervention on other health outcomes like malaria incidence, growth and development are unclear.","If fortifying condiments and seasonings with iron alone or iron plus other micronutrients improves measures of iron nutrition in the general population, in particular:
- anaemia;
- haemoglobin concentration;
- iron deficiency;
- iron status (including ferritin, transferrin saturation, and more). We also wanted to find out if consuming iron-fortified condiments/seasonings was associated with any unwanted effects. We searched for studies that provided iron-fortified condiments/seasonings to one group, and condiments/seasonings not fortified with iron to another. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on study characteristics. We identified 16 studies that involved 18,410 participants in middle-income countries, most within schools or communities, with study durations ranging from three months to two years. The type of iron-fortified condiments/seasonings used included salt, fish sauce, soy sauce, and seasoning powders. The dose of iron received by participants ranged from 4.4mg to 55 mg/day. Compared to unfortified condiments/seasonings, those which are iron-fortified likely improve iron deficiency slightly. We are uncertain whether they reduce anaemia, improve haemoglobin, or other measures of iron status. Condiments/seasonings fortified with iron plus other micronutrients may reduce anaemia; we are uncertain about whether they improve haemoglobin or ferritin concentrations. They may improve iron deficiency and total iron binding capacity. No studies reported adverse effects. More studies are needed to determine the effect of iron-fortified condiments/seasonings on health such as malaria incidence, growth and development and any potential adverse effects. Our confidence in the evidence is very low to moderate; several factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, we observed limitations in the way few studies were conducted with respect to the recruitment of people to assign interventions (this means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments). Secondly, people in some studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, not all the studies provided data about everything that were interested in, and results were inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were small. The results of future research could differ from the results of this review. The evidence is up-to-date to January 2023. We judged the evidence in this review as very low to moderate certainty, which means we are not certain of the effect of condiments/seasonings with added iron on the reduction of anaemia and iron deficiency in people."
CD002272,"Two trials enrolling 54 infants in total, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Both reported only the short term results (4 to 6 hours) of the interventions. Only one infant (randomised to NCPAP) required intubation during this period. In a cross-over study of 20 infants, Ryan 1989 showed no significant difference in rates of apnea (events/hr) between the two interventions [WMD -0.10 (-0.53,0.33)]. Lin (1998) randomised 34 infants and demonstrated a greater reduction in frequency of apneas (events/hr) with NIPPV compared to NCPAP [WMD -1.19 (-2.31,-0.07)]. Meta-analysis of both trials showed no difference in pC02 (mmHg) at the end of the 4-6 hour study period [WMD 0.95 (-3.05,4.94)]. No data were reported on gastrointestinal complications. Implications for practice: NIPPV may be a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants with apnea that is frequent or severe. Its use appears to reduce the frequency of apneas more effectively than NCPAP. Additional safety and efficacy data are required before recommending NIPPV as standard therapy for apnea. Implications for research: Future trials with sufficient power should assess the efficacy (reduction in failure of therapy) and safety (GI complications) of NIPPV. Outcomes should be assessed throughout the entire period during which the infant requires assisted ventilation. The recent ability to synchronise NIPPV with an infant's spontaneous respirations is a promising development requiring further assessment.",This review of two small trials suggests that nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) delivered via nasal prongs may be more effective than NCPAP alone in preterm babies whose apneas are frequent or severe. Further research is needed to confirm effectiveness and safety as few babies have been studied so far.
CD007791,"We identified more than 12 studies that used antioxidants in the treatment of Friedreich ataxia, but only two small RCTs, with a combined total of 72 participants, both fulfilled the selection criteria for this review and published results. One of these trials compared idebenone with placebo, the other compared high-dose versus low-dose coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E (the trialists considered the low-dose medication to be the placebo). We identified two other completed RCTs, which remain unpublished; the interventions in these trials were pioglitazone (40 participants) and idebenone (232 participants). Other RCTs were of insufficient duration for inclusion. In the included studies, the primary outcome specified for the review, change in a validated Friedreich ataxia rating score, was measured using the International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). The results did not reveal any significant difference between the antioxidant-treated and the placebo groups (mean difference 0.79 points, 95% confidence interval -1.97 to 3.55 points; low-quality evidence). The published included studies did not assess the first secondary outcome, change in cardiac status as measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Both studies reported changes in cardiac measurements assessed by echocardiogram. The ejection fraction was not measured in the larger of the included studies (44 participants). In the smaller study (28 participants), it was normal at baseline and did not change with treatment. End-diastolic interventricular septal thickness showed a small decrease in the smaller of the two included studies. In the larger included study, there was no decrease, showing significant heterogeneity in the study results; our overall assessment of the quality of evidence for this outcome was very low. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was only available for the smaller RCT, which showed a significant decrease. The relevance of this change is unclear and the quality of evidence low. There were no deaths related to the treatment with antioxidants. We considered the published included studies at low risk of bias in six of seven domains assessed. One unpublished included RCT, a year-long study using idebenone (232 participants), published an interim report in May 2010 stating that the study reached neither its primary endpoint, which was change in the ICARS score, nor a key cardiological secondary endpoint, but data were not available for verification and analysis. Low-quality evidence from two small, published, randomised controlled trials neither support nor refute an effect from antioxidants (idebenone, or a combination of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E) on the neurological status of people with Friedreich ataxia, measured with a validated neurological rating scale. A large unpublished study of idebenone that reportedly failed to meet neurological or key cardiological endpoints, and a trial of pioglitazone remain unpublished, but on publication will very likely influence quality assessments and conclusions. A single study of idebenone provided low-quality evidence for a decrease in LVM, which is of uncertain clinical significance but of potential importance that needs to be clarified. According to low-quality evidence, serious and non-serious adverse events were rare in both antioxidant and placebo groups. No non-antioxidant agents have been investigated in RCTs of 12 months' duration.","We decided to review clinical trials that had participants who took antioxidants for at least 12 months, as Friedreich ataxia is a slowly progressing condition. A wide search of the medical literature found four randomised controlled trials, but only two of them had published results in medical journals. One trial, involving 28 participants, compared idebenone to a placebo. The other, involving 44 participants, compared high-dose and very low-dose combined coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E. The two unpublished trials studied pioglitazone in 40 participants and idebenone in 232 participants, but we had no data. According to low quality evidence from two small published trials included in the review, antioxidants did not improve neurological symptoms in Friedreich ataxia. An additional large, unpublished study of idebenone reportedly found no benefit from idebenone for heart or neurological symptoms, but data are not available for checking and analysis. When published this trial will very likely influence our quality assessments and conclusions. Although some measures of heart wall thickness and mass decreased in the smaller of the two published trials, the quality of this evidence was low or very low and the importance of these findings is not clear. . Numbers of serious or non-serious adverse events were low and similar with antioxidants and placebo. The only serious adverse event that required withdrawal of an antioxidant was increased bowel frequency in one person receiving coenzyme Q with vitamin E.
The evidence in the review is up to date to February 2016."
CD008675,"The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. All nine trials included the conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restrictions in the frequency of Dix-Hallpike conversion when compared to the Epley manoeuvre alone. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.22, P = 0.002). No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients. There was no evidence of benefit of mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley manoeuvre, or of additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre. No adverse effects were reported. There is evidence supporting a statistically significant effect of post-Epley postural restrictions in comparison to the Epley manoeuvre alone. However, it important to note that this statistically significant effect only highlights a small improvement in treatment efficacy. An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV. The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epley manoeuvre. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes. Further studies should employ a rigorous randomisation technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post-treatment Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer-term follow-up of patients.","We included 11 studies in this review, with a total of 855 participants. Nine studies looked at post-treatment postural restrictions (using a neck brace/head movement restrictions/instructions to sleep upright) following the Epley manoeuvre. There was a statistically significant difference found when these restrictions were compared to a control treatment of the Epley manoeuvre alone. Although there was a difference between the groups, adding postural restrictions conferred only a small additional benefit since the Epley manoeuvre was effective alone in just under 80% of patients. Four of the studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV (a subtype of BPPV which is similar to posterior canal BPPV, but has some distinct differences in terms of the signs and symptoms), dizziness and disequilibrium (the feeling of unsteadiness on ones feet) in some patients. Additionally, two studies looked into the application of oscillation/vibration to the mastoid region during the Epley manoeuvre compared to control; the intervention produced no difference in outcome between these groups. One study that also researched post-treatment postural restrictions looked into extra steps in the Epley manoeuvre. Compared to the control treatment there were no significant differences in outcomes. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies in the review. The results should be interpreted carefully and further trials are needed."
CD003248,"This update includes forty-eight studies, involving 5721 babies and their mothers, with data available from 40 studies involving 4884 babies and their mothers. Babies were between 24 and 36+6 weeks' gestation at birth and multiple births were included. The data are mostly from high-income countries. Delayed clamping ranged between 30 to 180 seconds, with most studies delaying for 30 to 60 seconds. Early clamping was less than 30 seconds and often immediate. UCM was mostly before cord clamping but some were milked after cord clamping. We undertook subgroup analysis by gestation and type of intervention, and sensitivity analyses by low risk of selection and attrition bias. All studies were high risk for performance bias and many were unclear for other aspects of risk of bias. Certainty of the evidence using GRADE was mostly low, mainly due to imprecision and unclear risk of bias. Delayed cord clamping (DCC) versus early cord clamping (ECC) both with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping (25 studies, 3100 babies and their mothers)
DCC probably reduces the number of babies who die before discharge compared with ECC (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.98, 20 studies, 2680 babies (moderate certainty)). No studies reported on 'Death or neurodevelopmental impairment' in the early years'. DCC may make little or no difference to the number of babies with severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH grades 3 and 4) (aRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.39, 10 studies, 2058 babies, low certainty) but slightly reduces the number of babies with any grade IVH (aRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99, 15 studies, 2333 babies, high certainty). DCC has little or no effect on chronic lung disease (CLD) (aRR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.14, 6 studies, 1644 babies, high certainty). Due to insufficient data, we were unable to form conclusions regarding periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (aRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.30, 4 studies, 1544 babies, low certainty) or maternal blood loss of 500 mL or greater (aRR 1.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.63, 2 studies, 180 women, very low certainty). We identified no important heterogeneity in subgroup or sensitivity analyses. Delayed cord clamping (DCC) with immediate neonatal care with cord intact versus early cord clamping (ECC) (one study, 276 babies and their mothers)
There are insufficient data to be confident in our findings, but DCC with immediate neonatal care with cord intact may reduce the number of babies who die before discharge, although the data are also compatible with a slight increase in mortality, compared with ECC (aRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.11, 1 study, 270 babies, low certainty). DCC may also reduce the number of babies who die or have neurodevelopmental impairment in early years (aRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96, 1 study, 218 babies, low certainty). There may be little or no difference in: severe IVH; all grades IVH; PVL; CLD; maternal blood loss ≥ 500 mL, assessed as low certainty mainly due to serious imprecision. Delayed cord clamping (DCC) with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping versus umbilical cord milking (UCM) (three studies, 322 babies and their mothers) and UCM versus early cord clamping (ECC) (11 studies, 1183 babies and their mothers)
There are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects of UCM compared with delayed or early clamping (mostly low or very low certainty). Delayed, rather than early, cord clamping may reduce the risk of death before discharge for babies born preterm. There is insufficient evidence to show what duration of delay is best, one or several minutes, and therefore the optimum time to clamp the umbilical cord remains unclear. Whilst the current evidence supports not clamping the cord before 30 seconds at preterm births, future trials could compare different lengths of delay. Immediate neonatal care with the cord intact requires further study, and there are insufficient data on UCM. The nine new reports awaiting further classification may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.","We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question (date of search: November 2017). Our updated review included 40 studies which provided data on 4884 babies and their mothers. Studies were undertaken across the world, but mostly in high-income countries. Births were in hospitals which practiced early clamping. For many outcomes there were insufficient data to be really confident of our findings. 1) For delayed cord clamping (with immediate care of the baby after cord clamping) compared with early cord clamping, we found it likely that fewer babies died before discharge (20 studies, 2680 babies). Also, fewer babies may have had any bleeding in the brain (15 studies, 2333 babies), but there was probably no difference in the numbers of babies with very serious brain bleeds (10 studies, 2058 babies). 2) Only one study of 276 babies and their mothers provided data on delayed cord clamping with immediate care of the baby beside the mother with cord intact compared with early cord clamping. This study was small and did not identify any marked differences in health outcomes. 3) For delayed cord clamping (with immediate care of the baby after cord clamping) versus cord milking, there were insufficient data (three studies, 322 babies) to make comparisons between outcomes. 4) For cord milking versus early cord clamping, we found 11 studies providing data with 1183 babies and their mothers. Again, there were insufficient data to make clear comparisons on outcomes. Delayed cord clamping probably reduced the risk of death for babies born preterm. Early cord clamping probably causes harm. No studies showed what length of delay was best, and only a few studies followed babies for health outcomes in early childhood. There is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions on providing immediate care for the baby beside the mother with the cord intact. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions on cord milking. Further studies are in progress."
CD011312,"We included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 212 participants in the analyses. All included participants were under five years of age. Using GRADE, we assessed there was low-quality evidence for all analysed outcomes. We assessed high risk of performance and detection bias for two studies due to their unblinded setting. Levosimendan showed no clear effect on risk of mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 1.82; participants = 123; studies = 3) and no clear effect on low cardiac output syndrome (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.04; participants = 83; studies = 2) compared to standard treatments. Data on time-to-death were not available from any of the included studies. There was no conclusive evidence on the effect of levosimendan on the secondary outcomes. The length of intensive care unit stays (mean difference (MD) 0.33 days, 95% CI -1.16 to 1.82; participants = 188; studies = 4), length of hospital stays (MD 0.26 days, 95% CI -3.50 to 4.03; participants = 75; studies = 2), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -0.04 days, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.00; participants = 208; studies = 5), and the risk of mechanical circulatory support or cardiac transplantation (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.37; participants = 60; studies = 2) did not clearly differ between the groups. Published data about adverse effects of levosimendan were limited. A meta-analysis of hypotension, one of the most feared side effects of levosimendan, was not feasible because of the heterogeneous expression of blood pressure values. The current level of evidence is insufficient to judge whether prophylactic levosimendan prevents low cardiac output syndrome and mortality in paediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. So far, no significant differences have been detected between levosimendan and standard inotrope treatments in this setting. The authors evaluated the quality of evidence as low, using the GRADE approach. Reasons for downgrading were serious risk of bias (performance and detection bias due to unblinded setting of two RCTs), serious risk of inconsistency, and serious to very serious risk of imprecision (small number of included patients, low event rates).","We identified five studies that had a total of 212 patients. All patients were under five years of age. The patients were given levosimendan during or immediately after heart surgery for a duration of 20 to 72 hours. They were monitored for 20 hours to six days. We asked all of the study authors for additional information about their trials. All but one author responded. The evidence is current to June 2016. We found low-quality evidence for all outcomes. This was mainly due to the small number of included patients (high imprecision of results). Thus, all results of the meta-analysis must be viewed with caution. The available data revealed no clear difference between levosimendan and conventional medication in preventing reduced heart function and death after heart surgery in the studied population. We also found no clear difference in the length of stay in the intensive care unit. The available data did not allow us to judge whether one of the treatment arms was superior to the other for three secondary outcomes: length of hospital stay, time on mechanical ventilation, need to implant circulatory support devices or the need for cardiac transplantation. Overall, few side effects were reported in any of the groups. We were unable to pool data to generate useful information about the safety of levosimendan."
CD009293,"A single study enrolling 68 non-intubated children was found eligible for inclusion in review. The study had low or unclear risk of bias. It demonstrated no significant difference in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, hospital admission rate (odds ratio (OR) 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 2.58) and need for mechanical ventilation between ketamine (0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus over one to two minutes, followed by a 0.5 mg/kg per hour continuous infusion for two hours) and placebo group. There were no significant side effects of ketamine in the study. There was also no difference in need for other adjuvant therapy (OR 2.19; 95% CI 0.19 to 25.40) and in Pulmonary Index Score (mean difference (MD) -0.40; 95% CI -1.21 to 0.41) between the groups. The single study on non-intubated children with severe acute asthma did not show significant benefit and does not support the case studies and observational reports showing benefits of ketamine in both non-ventilated and ventilated children. There were no significant side effects of ketamine. We could not find any trials on ventilated children. To prove that ketamine is an effective treatment for acute asthma in children, there is need for sufficiently powered randomised trials of high methodological quality with objective outcome measures of clinical importance. Future trials should also explore different doses of ketamine and its role in children needing ventilation because of severe acute asthma.","We found, through systematic search, only one study where investigators assessed the usefulness of ketamine for management of severe acute asthma in children. While this single study suggested that there is a lack of evidence for usefulness of ketamine in acute exacerbation of asthma in children, more trials are needed regarding the use of ketamine in acute asthma before more specific recommendations can be made."
CD004690,"Forty-one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR of 7.85 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.60, Z = 10.34, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.05, I² = 30%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 3.0 (95% CI 1.75 to 3.03). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically significant. Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.","CBT is significantly more effective than no therapy in reducing symptoms of anxiety in children and young people. No clear evidence indicates that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, individually, with parents). CBT is no more effective than other 'active therapies' such as self-help books. The small number of studies meant the review authors could not compare CBT with medication. Only four studies looked at longer-term outcomes after CBT. No clear evidence showed maintained improvement in symptoms of anxiety among children and young people. The review authors recommend that future research should look in greater detail at what makes CBT work best for children and young people, how CBT can be provided in the most cost-effective way, and how CBT can be adapted for different age groups."
CD006566,"We included two interrupted time-series studies conducted in the USA. One study was conducted in five large US transportation companies (N = 115,019) that carried passengers and/or cargo. Monthly injury rates were available from 1983 to 1999. In the study company, two interventions of interest were evaluated: mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing programmes. The third study focused only on mandatory random drug testing and was conducted on federal injury data that covered all truck drivers of interstate carriers. We recalculated the results from raw data provided by the study authors. Following reanalysis, we found that in one study mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing was associated with a significant decrease in the level of injuries immediately following the intervention (-1.25 injuries/100 person years, 95% CI -2.29 to -0.21) but did not significantly affect the existing long-term downward trend (-0.28 injuries/100 person years/year, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.21). Mandatory random drug testing was significantly associated with an immediate change in injury level following the intervention (1.26 injuries/100 person years, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.16) in one study, and in the second study there was no significant effect (-1.36/injuries/100 person years, 95% CI -1.69 to 0.41). In the long term, random drug testing was associated with a significant increase in the downward trend (-0.19 injuries/100 person years/year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.07) in one study, the other study was also associated with a significant improvement in the long-term downward trend (-0.83 fatal accidents/100 million vehicle miles/year, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.58). There is insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of drug and alcohol testing of occupational drivers for preventing injuries as a sole, effective, long-term solution in the context of workplace culture, peer interaction and other local factors. Cluster-randomised trials are needed to better address the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting.","We conducted a systematic search of the literature on the effects of alcohol and drug screening among occupational drivers for preventing injury. We then appraised the quality of the studies found and assessed their results. We found two time-series studies conducted in the USA. One was conducted in five large transportation companies, and it examined the effects of two interventions of interest: implementation of legislation for mandatory random drug testing and mandatory random and for-cause alcohol testing. The other study was conducted using national injury data. There is limited evidence that in the long term mandatory drug-testing interventions can be more effective than no intervention in reducing injuries in occupational drivers. For mandatory alcohol testing there was evidence of an immediate effect only. Given the widespread practice of alcohol and drug testing and the paucity of evaluation studies found, more evaluation studies are needed. Interrupted time-series is a feasible study design for evaluating interventions that aim at preventing alcohol and drug related injuries. However, time-series studies of higher quality and of long duration are needed to increase the level of evidence. A cluster-randomised trial would be the ideal study design to evaluate the effects of interventions for injury prevention in this occupational setting."
CD010571,"We included seven RCTs comprising 577 participants. There was no significant heterogeneity among trials for the outcome of PEP (P = 0.32; I2 = 15%). The PGW technique significantly increased PEP compared to other endoscopic techniques (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.42; low-quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was 13 (95% CI 5 to 89). Among the three studies that compared the PGW technique with persistent CC, the incidence of PEP was 13.5% for the PGW technique and 8.7% for persistent CC (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.01; low-quality evidence). Among the two studies that compared the PGW technique with precut sphincterotomy, the incidence of PEP was 29.8% in the PGW group versus 10.3% in the precut group (RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.88; low-quality evidence). Among the two studies that compared the PGW technique with PD stent placement, the incidence of PEP was 11.7% for the PGW technique and 5.0% for PD stent placement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.08 to 37.50; very low-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in common bile duct (CBD) cannulation success with the randomised technique (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24; low-quality evidence) or overall CBD cannulation success (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18; low-quality evidence) between the PGW technique and other endoscopic techniques. There was also no statistically significant difference in the risk of other ERCP-related complications (bleeding, perforation, cholangitis, and mortality). The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. The overall quality of evidence for the outcome of PEP was low or very low because of study limitations and imprecision. In people with difficult CBD cannulation, sole use of the PGW technique appears to be associated with an increased risk of PEP. Prophylactic PD stenting after use of the PGW technique may reduce the risk of PEP. However, the PGW technique is not superior to persistent attempts with CC, precut sphincterotomy, or PD stent in achieving CBD cannulation. The influence of co-intervention in the form of rectal peri-procedural nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration is unclear.","We conducted a search of the literature on 15 April 2016. We identified seven randomised controlled trials conducted in China, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and the United States including a total of 577 participants. These trials compared the PGW technique versus persistent use of traditional techniques or other advanced techniques in people undergoing ERCP in whom access to the bile duct using traditional techniques was considered by the endoscopists to be difficult. As in clinical practice, the criteria used to define difficult access to the bile duct were highly variable among studies. We assessed outcomes of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), success rates in accessing the bile duct, and other post-ERCP complications (bleeding, infection, hole in the bowel wall, death). Contrary to popular belief, the PGW technique appears to increase the risk of PEP and does not improve the success rate of gaining access to the bile duct compared to other endoscopic techniques. The technique may increase the risk of mild PEP, but not moderate or severe PEP. There was no significant difference in success rates for accessing the bile duct. The risks for other complications such as bleeding, hole in the bowel wall, inflammation of the bile duct, and death appear to be low. Overall, we considered the quality of evidence for the outcome of PEP to be low. We considered none of the included studies to be at low risk of bias for all criteria. In most of the studies, both the participants and the medical staff were aware of which method was being used, therefore their judgments may not have been objective and the results should be interpreted cautiously."
CD003834,"The update search in 2012 detected two further studies that met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any further studies that met our inclusion criteria in the 2015 search. This review now includes 22 studies, with a total of 763 participants (median mean age: 35 years, range: 26 to 72 years). Most studies were small, of short duration, and incompletely reported. As we detected a high risk of bias in many studies, the overall methodological quality of the included sample was rather low. Three small studies comparing lithium with placebo as the sole treatment showed no difference in any of the outcomes we analysed. In eight studies comparing lithium with antipsychotic drugs as the sole treatment, more participants in the lithium group left the studies early (eight RCTs; n = 270, RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.11, low quality evidence). Thirteen studies examined whether the augmentation of antipsychotic drugs with lithium salts is more effective than antipsychotic drugs alone. More participants who received lithium augmentation had a clinically significant response (10 RCTs; n = 396, RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.97, low quality evidence). However, this effect became non-significant when we excluded participants with schizoaffective disorders in a sensitivity analysis (seven RCTs; n = 272, RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.81), when we excluded non-double-blind studies (seven RCTs; n = 224, RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.96), or when we excluded studies with high attrition (nine RCTs; n = 355, RR 1.67, CI 0.93 to 3.00). The overall acceptability of treatment (measured by the number of participants leaving the studies early) was not significantly different between groups (11 RCTs; n = 320, RR 1.89, CI 0.93 to 3.84, very low quality evidence). Few studies reported on side effects. There were no significant differences, but the database is too limited to make any judgement in this regard. For example, there were no data on thyroid dysfunction and kidney problems - two major and well-known side effects of lithium. The evidence base for the use of lithium in schizophrenia is limited to 22 studies of overall low methodological quality. There is no randomised trial-based evidence that lithium on its own is an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia. There is some GRADE low quality evidence that augmentation of antipsychotics with lithium is effective, but the effects are not significant when more prone-to-bias open RCTs are excluded. Nevertheless, further large and well-designed trials are justified. These should concentrate on two target groups: (1) people with no affective symptoms, so that trialists can determine whether lithium has an effect on the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and (2) people with schizoaffective disorders for whom lithium is widely used in clinical practice, although there is no evidence to support this use.","The update search in 2012 detected two further studies that met required standards, and no further studies were found in the 2015 search. This review now includes 22 randomised studies, with a total of 763 participants. The studies randomised people with schizophrenia or similar illnesses into groups that received either lithium or placebo (dummy drug), lithium or antipsychotic drugs, lithium plus antipsychotic drugs, or antipsychotic drugs alone. The findings in this review show that there is no good quality evidence that lithium on its own is effective for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. There is some low quality evidence for the effectiveness of lithium as an add-on treatment with antipsychotic drugs, but this result is inconclusive. Few studies reported on the side effects of lithium (such as kidney and thyroid problems). Most of the studies were small, of short duration, and poorly reported. The review authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes to be low or very low quality. Further large and well-designed trials are needed. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation (http://mcpin.org/), wrote this plain language summary."
CD006507,"Four studies, including 83 participants, are included in this review. Two studies used mantra meditation while the other two used yoga compared with drugs, relaxation training, non-specific exercises and standard treatment control. Design limitations caused high risk of bias across the studies. Only one out of four studies provided data appropriate for analysis. For this study there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the drug therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -2.72, 95% CI -8.49 to 3.05, 15 patients). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -0.52, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.84, 17 patients). There was also no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group in the distraction test (MD -8.34, 95% CI -107.05 to 90.37, 17 patients). As a result of the limited number of included studies, the small sample sizes and the high risk of bias, we are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of meditation therapy for ADHD. The adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.","The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of this treatment. As a result of the small number of studies that we were able to include in this review and the limitations of those studies, we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of meditation therapy for ADHD. No adverse effects of meditation in children have been reported. More trials are needed on meditation therapies for ADHD so that conclusions can be drawn regarding its effectiveness."
CD015422,"Thirteen articles relating to eight trials met the inclusion criteria and were qualitatively described. We included six trials in the meta-analysis (five cRCTs and one RCT). Effect on malaria incidence
Topical repellents may slightly reduce P falciparum infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.98; 3 cRCTs and 1 RCT, 61,651 participants; low-certainty evidence); but not when these two outcomes were considered independently. Two cRCTs and one RCT (12,813 participants) evaluated the effect of topical repellents on infection incidence (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.02; low-certainty evidence). One cRCT (48,838 participants) evaluated their effect on clinical case incidence (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.36; low-certainty evidence). Three studies (2 cRCTs and 1 RCT) included participants belonging to groups considered at high-risk of being infected, while only one cRCT did not include participants at high risk. Adverse events
Topical repellents are considered safe. The prevalence of adverse events among participants who used topical repellents was very low (0.6%, 283/47,515) and limited to mild skin reactions. Effect on malaria prevalence
Topical repellents may slightly reduce P falciparum prevalence (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97; 3 cRCTs and 1 RCT; 55,366 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two of these studies (1 cRCT and 1 RCT) were carried out in refugee camps, and included exclusively high-risk populations that were not receiving any other background vector control intervention. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that topical repellents can prevent malaria in settings where other vector control interventions are in place. We found the certainty of evidence for all outcomes to be low, primarily due to the risk of bias. A protective effect was suggested among high-risk populations, specially refugees, who might not have access to other standard vector control measures. More adequately powered clinical trials carried out in refugee camps could provide further information on the potential benefit of topical repellents in this setting. Individually randomized studies are also likely necessary to understand whether topical repellents have an effect on personal protection, and the degree to which diversion to non-protected participants affects overall transmission dynamics. Despite this, the potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.","The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if topical insect repellents (substances applied to the skin to prevent mosquito bites) can prevent malaria in people living in regions where this disease occurs regularly. We were particularly interested in their effect on people who might not be adequately protected by other measures, which are more commonly used to prevent malaria. We wanted to find out if topical repellents were better than a placebo, or no intervention at all, to reduce two indicators of malaria transmission:
• Malaria incidence (the number of new cases in a period of time);
• Malaria prevalence (the number of all cases at a certain moment). We also wanted to know if topical repellents caused any adverse side effects to people who used them. We searched the existing literature for studies that compared the effect of topical repellents (alone or in combination with other tools to prevent mosquito bites) with a placebo or no intervention. We compared and summarized the results of the included studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence they provided, based on the methods used in each one. We included a total of eight studies, which included over 60,000 people. The studies took place in areas with low malaria transmission, mostly in Southeast Asia and South America. The topical repellents evaluated included lotions, soaps, and cosmetics. We found evidence suggesting that topical repellents may slightly reduce the incidence and prevalence of malaria cases caused by P falciparum in settings where other tools to prevent mosquito bites are not available. Despite this, our findings suggest that repellents probably make little or no difference in places where these tools are already widely used. Topical repellents are considered safe, and the prevalence of adverse side effects was very low. The benefits of topical repellents were particularly clear among refugees. However, shortfalls in the design of the included studies did not allow us to generalize these observations to other contexts. We only included cases of malaria caused by the parasite P falciparum. We also recognize that studies measured and reported adherence differently, and often did not know if the participants actually used the repellent as advised. The evidence is up to date to 11 January 2023."
CD004381,"We included 16 new studies in this update which brought the total number of included studies to 26 (1165 participants). These studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy (intervention duration: three days to eight months) for autistic people in individual or group settings. More than half of the studies were conducted in North America or Asia. Twenty-one studies included children aged from two to 12 years. Five studies included children and adolescents, and/or young adults. Severity levels, language skills, and cognition were widely variable across studies. Measured immediately post-intervention, music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care was more likely to positively effect global improvement (risk ratio (RR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.40; 8 studies, 583 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 11 for low-risk population, 95% CI 6 to 39; NNTB = 6 for high-risk population, 95% CI 3 to 21) and to slightly increase quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49; 3 RCTs, 340 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, small to medium effect size). In addition, music therapy probably results in a large reduction in total autism symptom severity (SMD −0.83, 95% CI −1.41 to −0.24; 9 studies, 575 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No clear evidence of a difference between music therapy and comparison groups at immediately post-intervention was found for social interaction (SMD 0.26, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.57, 12 studies, 603 participants; low-certainty evidence); non-verbal communication (SMD 0.26, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.55; 7 RCTs, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence); and verbal communication (SMD 0.30, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.78; 8 studies, 276 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies investigated adverse events with one (36 participants) reporting no adverse events; the other study found no differences between music therapy and standard care immediately post-intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.94; 1 study, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy is probably associated with an increased chance of global improvement for autistic people, likely helps them to improve total autism severity and quality of life, and probably does not increase adverse events immediately after the intervention. The certainty of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for these four outcomes, meaning that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. No clear evidence of a difference was found for social interaction, non-verbal communication, and verbal communication measured immediately post-intervention. For these outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was rated as 'low' or 'very low', meaning that the true effect may be substantially different from these results. Compared with earlier versions of this review, the new studies included in this update helped to increase the certainty and applicability of this review's findings through larger sample sizes, extended age groups, longer periods of intervention and inclusion of follow-up assessments, and by predominantly using validated scales measuring generalised behaviour (i.e. behaviour outside of the therapy context). This new evidence is important for autistic individuals and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around the types and amount of intervention that should be provided and in the planning of resources. The applicability of the findings is still limited to the age groups included in the studies, and no direct conclusions can be drawn about music therapy in autistic individuals above the young adult age. More research using rigorous designs, relevant outcome measures, and longer-term follow-up periods is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring.","We included 16 new studies in this update, so the evidence in this review now rests on 26 studies with a total number of 1165 participants. The studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (three days to eight months) for autistic children, youth, and young adults in one-to-one or group settings. None of the studies reported funding by an agency with a commercial interest in the result of the studies; reported sources of support included governmental, university and foundation funding; in three studies, support was provided by a music therapy association. Music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care probably increases the chance of overall improvement by the end of therapy, likely improves quality of life and total autism symptom severity immediately after therapy, and probably does not increase adverse events. From the available evidence, we cannot tell whether music therapy has any effects on social interaction, and verbal and non-verbal communication at the end of therapy. The evidence we found in this review is of very low to moderate certainty. This means that future research may change these findings and our confidence in them. We found that music therapy is probably effective regarding global improvement, quality of life, total autism symptom severity and adverse events measured at the end of therapy based on the moderate certainty of the evidence in these domains. It remains unclear whether music therapy has an effect on social interaction, non-verbal communication and verbal communication at the end of therapy since the certainty of evidence was low to very low. Reasons for limited certainty of the evidence were issues with study design and blinding (i.e. those who applied outcome measures often knew whether or not participants had received music therapy, which may have influenced their assessments). Music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care probably increases the chance of overall improvement by the end of therapy. It also probably helps to enhance quality of life, and lessen symptom severity. Music therapy probably does not increase adverse events. We cannot tell whether music therapy may help with social interaction, non-verbal communication and verbal communication at the end of therapy. Most of the included studies featured interventions that correspond well with music therapy in clinical practice concerning methods and settings. This new evidence is important for autistic people and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around what intervention to choose, and in the planning of resources. More research with adequate design (i.e. producing reliable evidence) looking at areas that matter to autistic people is needed. Because long-term outcomes of therapy matter to autistic people and their families, it is important to specifically examine how long the effects of music therapy last."
CD013866,"We retrieved nine studies with 3424 participants with treatment-resistant depression, defined as lack of response to at least two trials of antidepressant monotherapy. The age of participants was 18 to 65 years in seven studies, 18 to 75 years in one study, and older than 65 years in one study. Inclusion criteria for all studies required a diagnosis of MDD with a current major depressive episode per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Text Revision Fourth Edition criteria and additional criteria on minimal scores on Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale which varied across studies. Eight studies compared brexpiprazole as adjunctive treatment to an antidepressant versus placebo as adjunctive treatment to an antidepressant. One study added brexpiprazole or placebo to a combination of antidepressant and ketamine. Four studies used fixed dosages and five studies used flexible dosages of brexpiprazole. The manufacturer sponsored eight studies and one study was independently funded. Brexpiprazole was superior in achieving response at eight weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 1.75; 8 studies, 3409 participants; high-certainty evidence). More participants randomised to brexpiprazole dropped out due to any cause at eight weeks (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.83; 7 studies, 2523 participants; high-certainty evidence) or due to adverse effects (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.05; 6 studies, 2472 participants; high-certainty evidence). Brexpiprazole was superior to placebo when added to an antidepressant for achieving remission at eight weeks (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.79; 7 studies, 3358 participants; high-certainty evidence). When response was defined based on a change in the score on MADRS, brexpiprazole also demonstrated better efficacy than placebo (mean difference (MD) –1.39, 95% CI –1.96 to –0.82; 8 studies, 3263 participants; high-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, add-on brexpiprazole is probably more likely to result in akathisia (OR 2.95, 95% CI 2.06 to 4.21; 7 studies, 3358 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and weight gain (OR 3.14, 95% CI 2.19 to 4.49; 9 studies, 3424 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The risk of bias varied between low and unclear for most studies. Only one study was at high risk of selective reporting bias and other bias; however, this study had a small sample size and its impact on overall risk of bias was not considered significant. The certainty of the evidence on five of the main outcomes (response to treatment, measured as number of participants who achieved response and change in depressive symptoms, remission, dropouts due to any cause, dropouts due to adverse effects) was high. The certainty of evidence for akathisia and weight gain was downgraded one level to moderate due to indirectness. Our review supports the superior efficacy of add-on brexpiprazole in comparison to placebo in adults with treatment-resistant depression for the short-term and acute treatment of depression. Our findings were limited by the small number of studies and the moderate-certainty evidence for the most common adverse effects (akathisia and weight gain). There was insufficient evidence for the effects of brexpiprazole for depression in older people or children. In addition, we found no studies that compared brexpiprazole to other antidepressants or where brexpiprazole was added after lack of response to only one antidepressant. We also lacked sufficient data to establish the long-term efficacy of brexpiprazole as adjunctive treatment. Active comparators, long-term studies in different age groups and cost-effect analyses are needed to more precisely establish the clinical role of brexpiprazole in the treatment of MDD.","We wanted to examine the effects of brexpiprazole in the treatment of depression when prescribed by itself or when added to another antidepressant and how its effects compare to the effects of antidepressants or placebo. To do so we explored several effects. First, we looked into how well brexpiprazole decreased the symptoms of depression. Second, we explored how many participants gave up taking part in the studies for any reason. Third, we investigated how many stopped participating because of the unwanted effects they experienced. Fourth, we explored what unwanted effects emerged with the use of brexpiprazole. We also wanted to know how brexpiprazole affected the quality of life of the participants and how it affected the way they functioned in their everyday lives. We searched scientific databases for studies that reported the effects of brexpiprazole versus placebo or antidepressants for depression. We included only studies in which the participants were assigned randomly to one or the other treatment. Neither them nor the team that was evaluating the effects of the treatment knew what was prescribed and this helped to objectively evaluate the results without the knowledge of what was prescribed impacting on the outcome. We compared and summarised the results and evaluated how confident we were that the results of the studies represented the real effects of the medication. We based our confidence on different factors such as the size of the effects, the methods used, and what and how the results were reported. We found nine studies, which included 3424 participants; two-thirds of them were women and one-third were men. We only found studies in which brexpiprazole was added after the participants had tried treatment with two or more antidepressants on their own. We have a high level of confidence that brexpiprazole added to an antidepressant reduced the symptoms of depression more after eight weeks of treatment than placebo added to an antidepressant. Brexpiprazole was also more likely to lead to no symptoms of depression than placebo when either of them was added to an antidepressant. We are moderately confident that brexpiprazole caused weight gain or subjective feelings of restlessness more often than placebo. We are less confident about the results around these unwanted effects as we could not find information about how they were measured and whether all studies used the same methods to measure them. We found no studies that explored how brexpiprazole would work for children or older people who have depression. We wanted to find how brexpiprazole would work when given for depression for longer periods of time, such as 18 to 24 weeks, but we found only one study and its results were not enough to draw a conclusion. Our evidence is up-to-date to 1 November 2021."
CD005109,"The risk of bias in the included studies was low. The overall quality of the evidence based on the GRADE approach was moderate. No statistically significant differences were found between interleukin 10 and placebo for complete remission (CDAI < 150 with a 100 point decrease in CDAI from baseline; RR=1.43; 95% CI 0.62 to 3.29; I2=40%) or clinical remission (CDAI < 150; RR=1.29; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.11; I2= 0%). Patients treated with interleukin 10 were significantly more likely to withdraw from the studies due to adverse events (RR=13.50; 95% CI 3.89 to 46.79; I2=0%). Interleukin 10 does not appear to provide any benefit for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. This systematic review shows that interleukin 10 does not increase the number of remissions (complete or clinical), but increases the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events relative to placebo. The quality of the evidence regarding the efficacy of IL-10 is moderate and although further research may have an impact on point estimates of efficacy further randomized trials are unlikely to be undertaken.",This systematic review showed that this drug does not increase the number of remissions but increases the number of patients that withdrew from the included studies due to side effects. The methodological quality of the included studies was high. Further studies of this agent for the treatment of active Crohn's disease are unlikely to be undertaken.
CD005601,"Ten studies were included in the review but only five reported data that could be used. Three of the ten studies were related to exercise-based psychological interventions. Seven were related to psychological interventions. No meta-analyses were possible due to diversity of participants, interventions and outcomes. Two studies compared a psychosocial intervention versus another intervention. Three studies compared a psychosocial intervention to a control group. Only one primary prevention trial reported data for the primary outcomes and, although this study found a significant difference in depression in favour of the intervention at endpoint, this difference was no longer evident at 18 months. No studies of primary prevention comparing different interventions and reporting primary outcomes of interest were identified. The methodological quality of the included studies was summarised. No study met our full quality criteria and one was regarded as low-quality. The remainder could not be rated because of incomplete data in the published reports and inadequate responses from the trialists. There is evidence only from individual small and low quality trials with minimal data suggesting that police officers benefit from psychosocial interventions, in terms of physical symptoms and psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, cynicism, anger, PTSD, marital problems and distress. No data on adverse effects were available. Meta-analyses of the available data were not possible. Further well-designed trials of psychosocial interventions are required. Research is needed on organization-based interventions to enhance psychological health among police officers.","In view of the importance of the functions performed by law enforcement officers, and the fact that there is no definitive approach to deal with psychological problems they may develop, a systematic review of the evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in preventing these problems in this select population. We found ten randomised trials, but not of all these contributed useful data for this review and quantitative meta-analyses were not possible. No data on adverse effects were available. The available evidence is, therefore, limited to the analysis of single, small and low quality trials. This suggests that police officers may benefit from psychosocial interventions in terms of psychological symptoms and physical symptoms. Further well-designed trials of psychosocial interventions to enhance the psychological health of police officers are required. Trials of organisation-based interventions are also needed."
CD011130,"One trial, undertaken in 1983, was eligible for inclusion in the review. This was a double-blind placebo-controlled quasi-randomised triaI of supplementation of folic acid in people with SCD. A total of 117 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease aged six months to four years of age participated over a one-year period (analysis was restricted to 115 children). Serum folate measures, obtained after trial entry at six and 12 months, were available in 80 of 115 (70%) participants. There were significant differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to serum folate values above 18 µg/L and values below 5 µg/L (low-quality evidence). In the folic acid group, values above 18 µg/L were observed in 33 of 41 (81%) compared to six of 39 (15%) participants in the placebo (calcium lactate) group. Additionally, there were no participants in the folic acid group with serum folate levels below 5 µg/L, whereas in the placebo group, 15 of 39 (39%) participants had levels below this threshold. Haematological indices were measured in 100 of 115 (87%) participants at baseline and at one year. After adjusting for sex and age group, the investigators reported no significant differences between the trial groups with regards to total haemoglobin concentrations, either at baseline or at one year (low-quality evidence). It is important to note that none of the raw data for the outcomes listed above were available for analysis. The proportions of participants who experienced certain clinical events were analysed in all 115 participants, for which raw data were available. There were no statistically significant differences noted; however, the trial was not powered to investigate differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to: minor infections, risk ratio (RR) 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.15) (low-quality evidence); major infections, RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.66) (low-quality evidence); dactylitis, RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.27) (low-quality evidence); acute splenic sequestration, RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.57) (low-quality evidence); or episodes of pain, RR 1.16 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.92) (low-quality evidence). However, the investigators reported a higher proportion of repeat dactylitis episodes in the placebo group, with two or more attacks occurring in 10 of 56 participants compared to two of 59 in the folic acid group (P < 0.05). Growth, determined by height-for-age and weight-for-age, as well as height and growth velocity, was measured in 103 of the 115 participants (90%), for which raw data were not available. The investigators reported no significant differences in growth between the two groups. The trial had a high risk of bias with regards to random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data. There was an unclear risk of bias in relation to allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Finally, There was a low risk of bias with regards to blinding of participants and personnel. Overall the quality of the evidence in the review was low. There were no trials identified for other eligible comparisons, namely: folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus placebo; folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet) versus placebo; folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet). One doubIe-blind, placebo-controlled triaI on folic acid supplementation in children with SCD was included in the review. Overall, the trial presented mixed evidence on the review's outcomes. No trials in adults were identified. With the limited evidence provided, we conclude that, while it is possible that folic acid supplementation may increase serum folate levels, the effect of supplementation on anaemia and any symptoms of anaemia remains unclear. If further trials were conducted, these may add evidence regarding the efficacy of folate supplementation. Future trials should assess clinical outcomes such as folate concentration, haemoglobin concentration, adverse effects and benefits of the intervention, especially with regards to SCD-related morbidity. Such trials should include people with SCD of all ages and both sexes, in any setting. To investigate the effects of folate supplementation, trials should recruit more participants and be of longer duration, with long-term follow-up, than the trial currently included in this review. However, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated.","We included one trial with 117 children with SCD aged between six months and four years. This was a one-year doubIe-blind (both participants and doctors did not know which treatment group the participants were allocated to) controlled triaI comparing children taking folic acid supplements to those taking a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). The trial investigators reported that folic acid supplementation led to higher levels of folic acid measured in the blood. However, there were no differences in haemoglobin concentrations at the end of one year. The trial also reported on clinical factors linked to treatment, including growth, major and minor infections, acute splenic sequestration, episodes of bone or abdominal pains. The investigators reported no differences in these outcomes from baseline to the end of the trial; however, the trial was not large enough to detect any possible differences reported between the folic acid group and the placebo group. In the included trial it was not clear how participants were allocated to receive folic acid or placebo. The method of making sure that participants and trial staff did not know what treatment each person was receiving (called allocation concealment) was also not described. These two factors mean that the trial had a high risk of biased results. The trial did not contain many participants. For many of its clinical endpoints, it was not designed to show differences between people taking folic acid and those taking a placebo. This means that the results from this trial are imprecise, and therefore hard to interpret. Finally, our review was meant to investigate folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in children and adults. Because we only identified one trial that investigated one form of supplementation in children, the results are not useful for other populations. Therefore, we judged the evidence from the included trial to be of low quality. Based on just one low quality study with evidence only to show that folate supplementation raises the blood levels of folic acid, we cannot state whether this treatment is effective or not. More trials with more people and longer treatment duration (and follow-up) of folate supplementation in people with SCD are needed to strengthen this review; however, we do not envisage further trials of this intervention will be conducted, and hence the review will no longer be regularly updated."
CD003789,"Four cross-over studies, published between 1968 and 1982, involving 121 patients, and four different NSAIDs were included. The generation of the allocation sequence and the use of methods to conceal the allocation were not described in any of the studies. The studies were double-blind but it was not clear whether the blinding was effective. Methods for collecting adverse effects were not described. The NSAIDs were preferred more often than paracetamol by the patients or the investigator. In the largest trial, 20 out of 54 patients (37%) preferred ibuprofen and 7 out of 54 (13%) paracetamol. Investigators preference (as established by joint tenderness, grip strength and joint circumference) was 17 out of 35 for diclofenac versus 5 out of 35 for paracetamol in another trial. However, because of the weaknesses in the trials, no firm conclusion can be drawn. When considering the trade off between the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol/acetaminophen, it is not known whether one is better than the other for rheumatoid arthritis. But people with rheumatoid arthritis and the researchers in the study did prefer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more than acetaminophen/paracetamol. There is a need for a large trial, with appropriate randomisation, double-blinding, test of the success of the blinding, and with explicit methods to measure and analyse pain and adverse effects.","This Cochrane review found only four old and small trials of poor quality that have compared the two types of drugs. There were a total of 121 patients in the four trials. In each trial, the patients tried both types of drugs, one after the other, in different periods of the trial. In the largest trial, of 54 patients, where each drug was tested twice, 20 patients preferred ibuprofen on both occasions, and 7 paracetamol. In the trials, each drug was used for only 4-7 days and side effects from the drugs were poorly reported. It is therefore not clear whether NSAIDs are better than paracetamol."
CD012548,"We included 11 studies with a follow-up of between three and 14 months. We also identified five ongoing trials. Primary outcomes
Data to evaluate overall survival were not available. Degarelix may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to standard androgen suppression therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05; low-certainty evidence; 2750 participants). Based on 114 serious adverse events in the standard androgen suppression group, this corresponds to 23 fewer serious adverse events per 1000 participants (43 fewer to 6 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes
Degarelix likely results in little to no difference in quality of life assessed with a variety of validated questionnaires (standardized mean difference 0.06 higher, 95% CI 0.05 lower to 0.18 higher; moderate-certainty evidence; 2887 participants), with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. Data to evaluate cancer-specific survival were not available. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61; very low-certainty evidence; 80 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, imprecision, and indirectness as this trial was conducted in a unique group of high-risk participants with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidities. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain (RR 15.68, 95% CI 7.41 to 33.17; moderate-certainty evidence; 2670 participants). Based on 30 participants per 1000 with injection site pain with standard androgen suppression therapy, this corresponds to 440 more injection site pains per 1000 participants (192 more to 965 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. We did not identify any relevant subgroup differences for different degarelix maintenance doses. We did not find trial evidence for overall survival or cancer-specific survival comparing degarelix to standard androgen suppression, but serious adverse events and quality of life may be similar between groups. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular events are very uncertain as the only eligible study had limitations, was small with few events, and was conducted in a high-risk population. Degarelix likely results in an increase in injection site pain compared to standard androgen suppression therapy. Maximum follow-up of included studies was 14 months, which is short. There is a need for methodologically better designed and executed studies with long-term follow-up evaluating men with metastatic prostate cancer.","We included randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in men with newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2020 for electronic databases, to October 2020 for trial registries, and to December 2020 for conference proceedings. We found 11 studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review, but none of these studies evaluated the risk of dying from any cause or dying from prostate cancer. There may be no difference between degarelix and standard hormonal therapy in serious unwanted effects and quality of life. The effects of degarelix on cardiovascular issues such as the risk of a heart attack or stroke are uncertain; while one study suggested that the risk may be reduced with degarelix, it had major issues, in particular that it was conducted in men at high risk for such problems. We found that degarelix therapy likely results in an increase in the occurrence of pain at the injection site. The certainty of evidence for the various outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. There is a need for additional, better designed studies to further understand the effects of degarelix for newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer."
CD008881,"We included two RCTs, seven CBA studies and two ITS studies. Nine studies with 7820 participants evaluated the screening process of pre-employment examinations as a whole, and two studies with 2164 participants evaluated the measures to mitigate the risks found following the screening process. The studies were too heterogeneous for statistical pooling of results. We rated the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as very low quality. The two new CBA studies both used historical controls and both had a high risk of bias. Of those studies that evaluated the screening process, there is very low quality evidence based on one RCT that a general examination for light duty work may not reduce the risk for sick leave (mean difference (MD) -0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.47 to 0.29). For army recruits, there is very low quality evidence based on one CBA study that there is a positive effect on fitness for duty after 12 months follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.85). We found inconsistent evidence of an effect of job-focused pre-employment examinations on the risk of musculoskeletal injuries in comparison with general or no pre-employment examination based on one RCT with high risk of bias, and four CBA studies. There is very low quality evidence based on one ITS study that incorporation of a bronchial challenge test may decrease occupational asthma (trend change -2.6, 95% CI -3.6 to -1.5) compared to a general pre-employment examination with lung function tests. Pre-employment examinations may also result in a rejection of the applicant for the new job. In six studies, the rates of rejecting job applicants increased because of the studied examinations , on average, from 2% to 35%, but not in one study. There is very low quality evidence based on two CBA studies that risk mitigation among applicants considered not fit for work at the pre-employment examination may result in a similar risk of work-related musculoskeletal injury during follow-up compared to workers considered fit for work at the health examination. There is very low quality evidence that a general examination for light duty work may not reduce the risk for sick leave, but may have a positive effect on fitness for duty for army recruits after 12 months follow-up. There is inconsistent evidence of an effect of job-focused pre-employment examinations on the risk of musculoskeletal injuries in comparison with general or no pre-employment examination. There is very low quality evidence that incorporation of a bronchial challenge test may decrease occupational asthma compared to a general pre-employment examination with lung function tests. Pre-employment examinations may result in an increase of rejecting job applicants in six out of seven studies. Risk mitigation based on the result of pre-employment examinations may be effective in reducing an increased risk for occupational injuries based on very low quality evidence. This evidence supports the current policy to restrict pre-employment examinations to only job-specific examinations. Better quality evaluation studies on pre-employment examinations are necessary, including the evaluation of the benefits of risk mitigation, given the effect on health and on the financial situation for those employees who do not pass the pre-employment examination.","One of the included studies found that a general examination did not reduce sick leave among light duty workers compared to no intervention. However, another study found that army recruits were more fit for duty 12 months after a health examination. Results were inconsistent in five studies that compared job-focused pre-employment examinations with no health examination or with a general health examination. Pre-employment examinations may also result in the rejection of a job applicant. In six studies the rates of rejecting job applicants because of health examinations increased, on average, from 2% to 35%, but not in one study. Two of the included 11 studies (including 2164 people) compared job applicants that were considered fit during the health examination to those who received particular recommendations to address health-related issues based on the health examination. Both studies reported no difference in musculoskeletal injury rates between groups during follow-up. This means that job applicants were able to take care of the health problems identified during their health examinations. We rated all studied comparisons providing very low quality evidence. Health examinations that focus on health risks of particular jobs may be effective. Adequately dealing with potential health risks by changing work tasks or physical fitness training may also be effective. We need more and better quality evaluation studies. Not allowing people to work in certain jobs may have effects on their health. It also costs them money. Future research should assess both."
CD001532,"Thirty four studies involving 4001 children were included. Interventions included; long-term low-dose antibiotics, surgical reimplantation of ureters, endoscopic injection treatment, probiotics, cranberry products, circumcision, and oxybutynin. Interventions were used alone and in combinations. The quality of conduct and reporting of these studies was variable, with many studies omitting crucial methodological information used to assess the risk of bias. Only four of the 34 studies were considered at low risk of bias across all fields of study quality. The majority of studies had many areas of uncertainty in the risk of bias fields, reflecting missing detail rather than stated poor design. Low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis compared to no treatment/placebo may make little or no difference to the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI (9 studies, 1667 children: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.09; low certainty evidence) and febrile UTI (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.21; low certainty evidence) at one to two years. At one to three years, antibiotic prophylaxis made little or no difference to the risk of new or progressive renal damage on DMSA scan (8 studies, 1503 children: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.61; low certainty evidence). Adverse events were reported in four studies with little or no difference between treatment groups (1056 children: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; ), but antibiotics increased the likelihood of bacterial drug resistance threefold (187 UTIs: RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.74; moderate certainty evidence). Seven studies compared long-term antibiotic prophylaxis alone with surgical reimplantation of ureters plus antibiotics, but only two reported the outcome febrile UTI (429 children). Surgery plus antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of repeat febrile UTI by 57% (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.70; moderate certainty evidence). There was little or no difference in the risk of new kidney defects detected using intravenous pyelogram at 4 to 5 years (4 studies, 572 children, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.49; moderate certainty evidence)
Four studies compared endoscopic injection with antibiotics alone and three reported the outcome febrile UTI. This analysis showed little or no difference in the risk of febrile UTI with endoscopic injection compared to antibiotics (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.78; low certainty evidence). Four studies involving 425 children compared two different materials for endoscopic injection under the ureters (polydimethylsiloxane (Macroplastique) versus dextranomer/hyaluronic acid polymer (Deflux), glutaraldehyde cross-linked (GAX) collagen (GAX) 35 versus GAX 65 and Deflux versus polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer (VANTRIS)) but only one study (255 children, low certainty evidence) had the outcome of febrile UTI and it reported no difference between the materials. All four studies reported rates of resolution of VUR, and the two studies comparing Macroplastique with Deflux showed that Macroplastique was probably superior to dextranomer/hyaluronic acid polymer (3 months: RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.78; 12 months: RR 0.54 95% CI 0.35 to 0.83; low certainty evidence)
Two studies compared probiotic treatment with antibiotics and showed little or no difference in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI (RR 0.82 95% CI 0.56 to 1.21; low certainty evidence)
Single studies compared circumcision with antibiotics, cranberry products with no treatment, oxybutynin with placebo, two different surgical techniques and endoscopic injection with no treatment. Compared with no treatment, the use of long-term, low-dose antibiotics may make little or no difference to the number of repeat symptomatic and febrile UTIs in children with VUR (low certainty evidence). Considerable variation in the study designs and subsequent findings prevented drawing firm conclusions on efficacy of antibiotic treatment. The added benefit of surgical or endoscopic correction of VUR over antibiotic treatment alone remains unclear since few studies comparing the same treatment and with relevant clinical outcomes were available for analysis.","A total of 34 randomised studies, involving 4001 children were identified and underwent data extraction and analysis. The most frequent comparisons were for long-term, low-dose antibiotics with no treatment (8 studies) or placebo (4 studies) and antibiotics versus surgical reimplantation of ureters plus antibiotics (7 studies). Other treatments looked at endoscopic correction by injection compared with antibiotics (3 studies), different materials for endoscopic correction (2 studies) circumcision (1 study), probiotics (1 study), cranberry product (1 study), and oxybutynin (2 studies). Meta-analysis of similar studies found that long-term low-dose antibiotic treatment compared with no treatment may lead to little or no difference in the risk for repeat UTIs in children with VUR. Associated side effects were infrequent and minor, but prophylaxis was associated with a threefold increased risk of bacterial resistance to the treatment drug in later infections. Surgery decreased the number of repeat UTIs with fever, but did not change the number of children developing UTI with illness or kidney damage. Many studies did not contribute to the meta-analysis as they failed to report relevant outcomes or were single studies examining a treatment option not used by other studies or combinations of treatments. Long-term low-dose antibiotic treatment in children with VUR makes little or no difference to the risk of repeat UTI causing a person to be unwell. Surgery may reduce the risk of repeat UTI with fever however this is based on two studies of 429 children who may not represent the majority and may not bear true in a more general group of children with VUR. Complementary therapies such as probiotics and cranberry were trialled in single or two studies and do not provide evidence of sufficient certainty to support or deny their use."
CD011882,"Three trials with 144 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two of the trials had a randomised cross-over design, one was a cross-over trial which we classified as quasi-randomised. Participants in the included studies were people with dementia living in nursing homes. They were predominantly women and had a mean age of over 80 years. SPT was performed using an audio or video recording prepared by family members or surrogates. It varied in its content, frequency of administration and duration. All the studies compared multiple treatments. In one study, SPT was compared with two other interventions; in the other two studies, it was compared with three other interventions. Specifically, SPT was compared to usual care, personalised music (two studies), a 'placebo' audiotape containing the voice of a person (two studies), and one-to-one social interaction performed by trained research assistants (one study). In terms of outcomes evaluated, one study considered agitation and withdrawn behaviour (both assessed with three methods); the second study evaluated verbal disruptive behaviour (assessed with three methods); and the third study evaluated physically agitated behaviour and verbally agitated behaviour (the method used was not clearly described). According to the GRADE criteria, the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very small numbers of participants and risk of bias in the included studies; (none of the trials was at low risk of selection bias; all the trials were at high risk of performance bias; one trial was at high risk of attrition bias; and all had unclear selective reporting). Because of variation in the participants, the format of SPT, the comparison interventions, and the measures used to assess outcomes, we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. Within each trial, the effect of SPT on behaviour, compared to usual care, was mixed and depended on the measure used. Two trials which included a personalised music intervention reported no significant differences between simulated presence and music on behavioural outcomes. Because the overall quality of the evidence was very low, we were very uncertain regarding all the results
None of the studies evaluated quality of life or any of our secondary outcome measures (performance of activities of daily living, dropout and carer burden). We were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of SPT for treating behavioural and psychological symptoms and improving quality of life of people with dementia. New high-quality studies are needed to investigate the effect of SPT.","We looked for trials which compared SPT to usual care or to another treatment. Ideally, people with dementia should have been randomly allocated to one or other treatment, but we also included trials even if treatment allocation was not strictly random. We found three trials which met our inclusion criteria. The 144 participants were all living in nursing homes. The majority were women with an average age of over 80 years and severe dementia. The way SPT was administered was different in each trial. All the trials used more than one comparison treatment, which differed between trials. The trials all attempted to measure an effect on agitated behaviours, but used different approaches. Because the trials were so different from each other, we were not able to pool the results. Individually, each trial reported different methods to assess the effect of SPT on behavioural problems and the results varied depending on the method used to measure the outcome. None of the studies assessed quality of life, effect on daily activities, effects on caregivers, or how likely participants were to drop out of the study. The studies were small and all had problems with their methods which could have biased their results. Hence, we thought the overall quality of the evidence was very low, meaning we cannot be at all confident in the results. Not enough high-quality research has been done to allow us to judge whether SPT can help people with dementia who are distressed or agitated."
CD004305,"In the current update, we have added six new relevant studies, resulting in a total of 17 studies included in this review involving financial interventions directed at smokers or healthcare providers, or both. Full financial interventions directed at smokers had a favourable effect on abstinence at six months or longer when compared to no intervention (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28, I² = 33%, 9333 participants). There was no evidence that full coverage interventions increased smoking abstinence compared to partial coverage interventions (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.48, I² = 64%, 5914 participants), but partial coverage interventions were more effective in increasing abstinence than no intervention (RR 1.27 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59, I² = 21%, 7108 participants). The economic evaluation showed costs per additional quitter ranging from USD 97 to USD 7646 for the comparison of full coverage with partial or no coverage. There was no clear evidence of an effect on smoking cessation when we pooled two trials of financial incentives directed at healthcare providers (RR 1.16, CI 0.98 to 1.37, I² = 0%, 2311 participants). Full financial interventions increased the number of participants making a quit attempt when compared to no interventions (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.17, I² = 15%, 9065 participants). There was insufficient evidence to show whether partial financial interventions increased quit attempts compared to no interventions (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.31, I² = 88%, 6944 participants). Full financial interventions increased the use of smoking cessation treatment compared to no interventions with regard to various pharmacological and behavioural treatments: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.09, I² = 35%, 9455 participants; bupropion: RR 3.22, 95% CI 1.41 to 7.34, I² = 71%, 6321 participants; behavioural therapy: RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.65, I² = 75%, 9215 participants. There was evidence that partial coverage compared to no coverage reported a small positive effect on the use of bupropion (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29, I² = 0%, 6765 participants). Interventions directed at healthcare providers increased the use of behavioural therapy (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.86, I² = 85%, 25820 participants), but not the use of NRT and/or bupropion (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18, I² = 6%, 2311 participants). We assessed the quality of the evidence for the main outcome, abstinence from smoking, as moderate. In most studies participants were not blinded to the different study arms and researchers were not blinded to the allocated interventions. Furthermore, there was not always sufficient information on attrition rates. We detected some imprecision but we judged this to be of minor consequence on the outcomes of this study. Full financial interventions directed at smokers when compared to no financial interventions increase the proportion of smokers who attempt to quit, use smoking cessation treatments, and succeed in quitting. There was no clear and consistent evidence of an effect on smoking cessation from financial incentives directed at healthcare providers. We are only moderately confident in the effect estimate because there was some risk of bias due to a lack of blinding in participants and researchers, and insufficient information on attrition rates.","We searched all relevant studies that involved financial interventions directed at smokers and healthcare providers. For smokers, the aim of the healthcare financing interventions had to be to encourage the use of smoking cessation treatment or making successful quit attempts. For interventions directed at healthcare providers, the intervention had to stimulate the healthcare provider to assist people with quitting smoking, for example by prescribing smoking cessation treatment. For the update of this review, we searched studies on the effect of financial interventions on smoking cessation treatment and success in September 2016. We found six new relevant studies, resulting in a total of 17 studies. We found 15 studies directed at smokers. Covering all the costs of smoking cessation treatment for smokers (free treatment) when compared to providing no financial benefits increased the number of smokers who attempted to quit (4 studies, 9065 participants), used smoking cessation treatments (7 studies, 9455 participants), and succeeded in quitting (6 studies, 9333 participants). We found three studies directed at healthcare providers. The two studies that investigated the effect of a financial intervention on quit success (2311 participants) did not clearly show an increase in quit rates. Financial interventions directed at healthcare providers also did not have an effect on the use of smoking cessation medication (2 studies, 2311 participants). However, financial interventions did increase the number of smokers who used smoking cessation counselling (3 studies, 25,820 participants). Information on the costs of the intervention was available for eight studies (33,488 participants). The economic evaluation of the individual studies showed that although the absolute differences in quitting were small, the costs per person successfully quitting were low or moderate. We concluded that financial interventions directed at smokers increase the proportion of smokers who attempt to quit, use smoking cessation treatments, and succeed in quitting. We did not detect a clear effect on smoking cessation from financial incentives directed at healthcare providers. This review has some limitations that affect how confident we can be in the conclusions. The included studies varied substantially in quality and in methods and design, which makes it difficult to compare results."
CD003574,"Ten studies were identified of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. The included studies either differed in the type of TNF-a blocking agent used or in the way outcomes were assessed to such an extent that we considered it inappropriate to combine the data statistically. There is evidence from one randomised controlled trial that suggests that a single intravenous infusion of the monoclonal antibody cA2, infliximab, may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. There was no difference in response rates among infliximab doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg. The results of two other trials suggested that CDP571, the genetically engineered human TNF monoclonal antibody, may also be effective in reducing disease activity index at 2 weeks after an infusion. We did not find any evidence to support the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. Evidence from one randomized controlled trial suggests that a single infusion of infliximab may be effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Based on this study, we can recommend a dose of 5 mg/kg. There is also some evidence that CDP571 may be effective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease. We did not find any evidence that supports the use of etanercept in Crohn's disease. The period of follow up for the patients in these studies was probably too short to allow adequate assessment of recently reported serious adverse effects such as tuberculosis and lymphoma.","This review shows that a single intravenous infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg) may be an effective treatment for patients with active Crohn's disease who no longer respond to corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs. There is also some evidence that CDP571, another TNF alpha blocking drug may be effective. There is no evidence to support the use of etanercept, a drug that blocks the action of TNF alpha by binding to receptors. There were no serious side effects associated with TNF blocking drugs, although the follow-up period of the studies reported in this review may have been too short to assess the development of serious side effects."
CD013878,"Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes were 16 and 20 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in causes for scarring (e.g. surgery, infected wounds, and trauma), site (e.g. chest and back), and ages of scars. The duration of follow-up was three and four and a half months. The included studies reported three comparisons; SGS compared with no treatment, SGS compared with non-silicone gel sheeting (a dressing similar to SGS but which does not contain silicone), and SGS compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide. One trial had a split-body design and one trial had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). The included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcome of scar severity measured by health professionals and no data were reported for severity of scar measured by patients or adverse events. For secondary outcomes some data on pain were reported, but health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were not reported. Both trials had suboptimal outcome reporting, thus many domains in the risk of bias were assessed as unclear. All evidence was rated as being very low-certainty, mainly due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. SGS compared with no treatment
Two studies with 33 participants (76 scars) reported the severity of scar assessed by health professionals, and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity compared with no treatment (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). We are uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with no treatment (21 participants with 40 scars; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. SGS compared with non-SGS
One study with 16 participants (25 scars) was included in this comparison. We are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity assessed by health professionals compared with non-SGS (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). We are also uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with non-SGS (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. SGS compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide
One study with 17 participants (51 scars) reported scar severity assessed by health professionals, and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). This study also reported pain assessed by health professionals among 5 participants (15 scars) and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide (very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for indirectness, and twice for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. There is currently a lack of RCT evidence about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of keloid scars. From the two studies identified, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether the use of SGS compared with no treatment, non-SGS, or intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide makes any difference in the treatment of keloid scars. Evidence from the included studies is of very low certainty, mainly driven by the risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision due to small sample size. Further well-designed studies that have good reporting methodologies and address important clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes are required to reduce uncertainty around decision-making in the use of SGS to treat keloid scars.","In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out what the benefits and risks of treating keloid scars with silicone gel sheeting are. We searched for studies that investigated using silicone gel sheeting to treat keloid scars. We searched for randomised controlled trials only, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. We found two studies with a total of 36 participants (85 scars) (33 participants (76 scars) completed the study). The participants had keloid scars caused by surgery, infected wounds or trauma. The studies compared the effects of silicone gel sheeting with:
- no treatment;
- treatment with a dressing similar to silicone gel sheeting that did not contain silicone;
- injections of triamcinolone acetonide (a medication) directly into a lesion or below the skin. One study was conducted in Brazil and another study was conducted in Singapore. They lasted for different lengths of time: three months and four and a half months. Both studies reported assessments of scars by healthcare professionals but no data were reported in a way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. Both studies also reported assessments of pain but no data were reported in a way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for people's well-being (quality of life); whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence); whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost-effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheeting improves a scar's appearance more than: no treatment; treatment with non-silicone gel sheeting; or intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide. We are uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheeting on pain compared with no treatment. We do not know if silicone gel sheeting has an effect on pain compared with non-silicone gel sheeting or intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide. We are uncertain whether the use of silicone gel sheeting compared with no treatment, treatment with non-silicone gel sheeting or intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide makes any difference in the treatment of keloid scars. We are not confident in the evidence because it comes from very few studies with small numbers of people and poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. This review includes evidence published up to 15 December 2021."
CD004427,"For the original Cochrane Review, the review authors identified two RCTs involving 54 participants with ALS receiving NIV. There were no new RCTs or quasi-RCTs at the first update. One new RCT was identified in the second update but was excluded for the reasons outlined below. Incomplete data were available for one published study comparing early and late initiation of NIV (13 participants). We contacted the trial authors, who were not able to provide the missing data. The conclusions of the review were therefore based on a single study of 41 participants comparing NIV with standard care. Lack of (or uncertain) blinding represented a risk of bias for participant- and clinician-assessed outcomes such as quality of life, but it was otherwise a well-conducted study with a low risk of bias. The study provided moderate-quality evidence that overall median survival was significantly different between the group treated with NIV and the standard care group. The median survival in the NIV group was 48 days longer (219 days compared to 171 days for the standard care group (estimated 95% confidence interval 12 to 91 days, P = 0.0062)). This survival benefit was accompanied by an enhanced quality of life. On subgroup analysis, in the subgroup with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function (20 participants), median survival was 205 days longer (216 days in the NIV group versus 11 days in the standard care group, P = 0.0059), and quality of life measures were better than with standard care (low-quality evidence). In the participants with poor bulbar function (21 participants), NIV did not prolong survival or improve quality of life, although there was significant improvement in the mean symptoms domain of the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index by some measures. Neither trial reported clinical data on intervention-related adverse effects. Moderate-quality evidence from a single RCT of NIV in 41 participants suggests that it significantly prolongs survival, and low-quality evidence indicates that it improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and quality of life were significantly improved in the subgroup of people with better bulbar function, but not in those with severe bulbar impairment. Adverse effects related to NIV should be systematically reported, as at present there is little information on this subject. More RCT evidence to support the use of NIV in ALS will be difficult to generate, as not offering NIV to the control group is no longer ethically justifiable. Future studies should examine the benefits of early intervention with NIV and establish the most appropriate timing for initiating NIV in order to obtain its maximum benefit. The effect of adding cough augmentation techniques to NIV also needs to be investigated in an RCT. Future studies should examine the health economics of NIV. Access to NIV remains restricted in many parts of the world, including Europe and North America. We need to understand the factors, personal and socioeconomic, that determine access to NIV.","In this updated review, we examined the evidence from two randomised trials of NIV in ALS involving a total of 54 participants. One of the trials, which studied when to start NIV, provided no usable data. A third trial, identified in a clinical trials register, currently has no published results. Complete data were only available from a single trial of 41 participants. The results of this trial provided moderate-quality evidence that NIV significantly prolongs survival, and low-quality evidence that it improves or maintains quality of life compared to standard care. Median survival was increased by an estimated 48 days, from 171 to 219 days. The survival benefit from NIV was much greater in people with ALS in whom the muscles used for speaking, chewing, and swallowing (bulbar muscles) were either unaffected or only moderately weak. Among these 20 participants, the median survival with NIV was increased by an estimated 205 days (216 days with NIV, compared to 11 days with standard care). Quality of life was also maintained in participants with mild to moderate bulbar weakness. In the 21 participants with severe bulbar weakness, NIV did not prolong survival or maintain quality of life scores, although a sleep-related symptoms score improved. Neither trial reported on adverse effects. Participants and clinicians were aware of the treatment groups, which can influence quality of life assessments. More trials of NIV versus standard care in ALS are unlikely as it would not be ethical to withhold NIV. Future studies should examine early intervention with NIV and determine the best time to start it. The evidence is up to date to January 2017."
CD004839,"A total of 17 trials involving 1061 participants (range 13 to 213 participants per trial) were included. Of these, 16 trials compared either deferiprone alone with desferrioxamine alone, or a combined therapy of deferiprone and desferrioxamine with either deferiprone alone or desferrioxamine alone; one compared different schedules of deferiprone. There was little consistency between outcomes and limited information to fully assess the risk of bias of most of the included trials. Four trials reported mortality; each reported the death of one individual receiving deferiprone with or without desferrioxamine. One trial reported five further deaths in patients who withdrew from randomised treatment (deferiprone with or without desferrioxamine) and switched to desferrioxamine alone. Seven trials reported cardiac function or liver fibrosis as measures of end organ damage. Earlier trials measuring the cardiac iron load indirectly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* signal had suggested deferiprone may reduce cardiac iron more quickly than desferrioxamine. However, a meta-analysis of two trials suggested that left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly reduced in patients who received desferrioxamine alone compared with combination therapy. One trial, which planned five years of follow up, was stopped early due to the beneficial effects of combined treatment compared with deferiprone alone in terms of serum ferritin levels reduction. The results of this and three other trials suggest an advantage of combined therapy over monotherapy to reduce iron stores as measured by serum ferritin. There is, however, no conclusive or consistent evidence for the improved efficacy of combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine therapy over monotherapy from direct or indirect measures of liver iron. Both deferiprone and desferrioxamine produce a significant reduction in iron stores in transfusion-dependent, iron-overloaded people. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to suggest that either has a greater reduction of clinically significant end organ damage. Evidence of adverse events were observed in all treatment groups. Occurrence of any adverse event was significantly more likely with deferiprone than desferrioxamine in one trial, RR 2.24 (95% CI 1.19 to 4.23). Meta-analysis of a further two trials showed a significant increased risk of adverse events associated with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine compared with desferrioxamine alone, RR 3.04 (95% CI 1.18 to 7.83). The most commonly reported adverse event was joint pain, which occurred significantly more frequently in patients receiving deferiprone than desferrioxamine, RR 2.64 (95% CI 1.21 to 5.77). Other common adverse events included gastrointestinal disturbances as well as neutropenia or leucopenia, or both. In the absence of data from randomised controlled trials, there is no evidence to suggest the need for a change in current treatment recommendations; namely that deferiprone is indicated for treating iron overload in people with thalassaemia major when desferrioxamine is contraindicated or inadequate. Intensified desferrioxamine treatment (by either subcutaneous or intravenous route) or use of other oral iron chelators, or both, remains the established treatment to reverse cardiac dysfunction due to iron overload. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently only gave support for deferiprone to be used as a last resort for treating iron overload in thalassaemia, myelodysplasia and sickle cell disease. However, there is evidence that adverse events are increased in patients treated with deferiprone compared with desferrioxamine and in patients treated with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine compared with desferrioxamine alone. There is an urgent need for adequately-powered, high-quality trials comparing the overall clinical efficacy and long-term outcome of deferiprone with desferrioxamine.","Seventeen randomised controlled trials compared deferiprone with desferrioxamine. They report little data on death or end organ damage, so we report the effects of therapy using mainly other markers. Removing excess iron was assessed by iron concentration in the blood and liver; heart function; and the amount of iron passed in urine. However, the amount of iron removed with either deferiprone or desferrioxamine was not consistent; one reason being that outcomes were measured differently. This makes it difficult to compare results between trials. Adverse events included joint pain, nausea, stomach upsets and low white blood cell count with deferiprone and pain or skin reactions at the injection site and joint pain with desferrioxamine. In one trial, the risk of an adverse event with deferiprone was twice that of the risk with desferrioxamine. Two further trials showed a three-fold increased risk of an adverse event with combined deferiprone and desferrioxamine therapy compared with desferrioxamine alone. We found no evidence to change current recommendations to treat iron overload in thalassaemia with deferiprone when desferrioxamine cannot be used or is inadequate. Intensified desferrioxamine treatment or use of other oral iron chelators (or both of these) remains the established treatment to reverse heart problems due to iron overload. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently gave support for deferiprone only to be used as a last resort treatment in patients with thalassaemia, myelodysplasia and sickle cell disease. The danger of raised liver enzymes or a very low white blood cell count with deferiprone means that this treatment should not be used unless close monitoring of full blood counts and liver function is possible. Large trials of chelation therapy with standardised measures of iron stores and end organ damage are needed so valuable trial data can be compared and analysed."
CD015232,"One RCT met our inclusion criteria, which was a prospective randomised blinded controlled trial conducted in Sheffield, UK in 2006. In total 64 participants undergoing transtibial amputation for non-reconstructable PAD were randomised to either tourniquet or no tourniquet to assess for intraoperative blood loss, fall in haemoglobin, transfusion requirement, wound healing, stump breakdown and revision. Ten participants were excluded postrandomisation (five from the tourniquet group and five from the no tourniquet group). The reported median volume of intraoperative blood loss was significantly less in the tourniquet group (255 mL (interquartile range (IQR) 150 to 572.5 mL))) compared to the control group (550 mL (IQR 255 to 1050 mL)) (P = 0.014). There was a significantly lower median drop in haemoglobin concentration in the tourniquet group (1.0 g/dL (IQR 0.6 to 2.4 g/dL)) compared to the control group (1.8 g/dL (IRQ 0 to 1.2 g/dL)) (P = 0.035). There was a significantly lower perioperative blood transfusion requirement in the tourniquet group (8 participants, 32%) compared to the control group (14 participants, 48%) (P = 0.047). There were no clear differences in wound breakdown, stump revision, primary wound healing at six weeks, postoperative complications (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema), and death between groups. We assessed the one included study as at low risk of bias for sequence generation and blinding of outcome assessors; high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting; and unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and other sources of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as low or very low due to risk of bias, small sample size, and the study being insufficiently powered for most outcomes. This review identified only one small historical RCT evaluating tourniquet use in MLLA. Tourniquets appeared to reduce intraoperative blood loss, drop in haemoglobin, and blood transfusion requirements following transtibial amputations for people with PAD. However, it is unclear whether tourniquets affect wound healing, stump revision rates, postoperative complications, or mortality. High-certainty evidence is required to inform clinical decision-making for the use of tourniquets in these patients.","We searched medical databases to find relevant studies that compared the use of tourniquets to no tourniquets in people undergoing amputation due to blockages in their blood vessels. We identified one randomised controlled trial (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) conducted in the UK. Sixty-four people undergoing amputation below the knee for severe blockages of their arteries were assigned to either tourniquet or no tourniquet. The study assessed blood loss during surgery, change in blood count, blood transfusion requirement, wound healing, and revision surgery. The results suggested that the use of a tourniquet during an amputation below the knee halved blood loss during surgery and reduced fall in blood counts and need for blood transfusions. However, there was no effect on wound healing, need for repeat amputation surgery, or other complications following the surgery including death. Because we found only one small study at high risk of bias in some areas, we have low confidence in the evidence for the use of tourniquets in people undergoing amputation. When tourniquets are used during amputation in the setting of blocked arteries, they appear to reduce blood loss during surgery as well as the need for blood transfusion. However, the evidence comes from one small study, and further high-quality studies are needed to help doctors decide about the use of tourniquets in these patients."
CD010446,"We included seven RCTs that involved a total of 542 women; of these, five recruited post-menopausal women (aged from 56 to 70 years) (422 women). We assessed all studies to be at high risk of bias. Meta-analyses comparing the overall effectiveness of treatments during acute phases of infection and rates of recurrence were conducted. Analysis of three studies involving 282 women that looked at CHM versus antibiotics suggested that CHM had a higher rate of effectiveness for acute UTI (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 33) and reduced recurrent UTI rates (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.82). Analysis of two studies involving 120 women that compared CHM plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone found the combined intervention had a higher rate of effectiveness for acute UTI (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47) and resulted in lower rates of recurrent infection six months after the study (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.80). One study comparing different CHM treatments found Er Xian Tang was more effective in treating acute infection in post-menopausal women than San Jin Pian (80 women: RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.57). Analysis showed that active CHM treatments specifically formulated for recurrent UTI were more effective in reducing infection incidence than generic CHM treatments that were more commonly used for acute UTI (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.77). Only two studies undertook to report adverse events; neither reported the occurrence of any adverse events. Evidence from seven small studies suggested that CHM as an independent intervention or in conjunction with antibiotics may be beneficial for treating recurrent UTIs during the acute phase of infection and may reduce the recurrent UTI incidence for at least six months post-treatment. CHM treatments specifically formulated for recurrent UTI may be more effective than herbal treatments designed to treat acute UTI. However, the small number and poor quality of the included studies meant that it was not possible to formulate robust conclusions on the use of CHM for recurrent UTI in women either alone or as an adjunct to antibiotics.","The studies suggested that CHM used either on its own or with antibiotic treatment may be more effective than antibiotics alone for relieving acute UTIs and preventing recurrent episodes. There were only two studies that explicitly stated that adverse events were to be reported; neither reported any adverse events. However, studies were small and assessed as having poor methodological quality; and most study participants were post-menopausal. Therefore, results should be interpreted cautiously and can only be considered as preliminary findings that may not be relevant to pre-menopausal women. Further research is required to provide more rigorous evidence before CHM can be routinely recommended as a treatment option for recurrent UTIs."
CD005257,"Three randomised trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated interventions for hyperkalaemia. Urine output was ascertained in only one study (Hu 1999). In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (Malone 1991), 19 (Singh 2002) and 40 infants enrolled (Hu 1999). The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991; Hu 1999). One study (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical significance: RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.15); RD -0.66 (95% CI -1.09 to -0.22); NNTB 2 (95% CI 1 to 5)]. In the study of Hu (Hu 1999), the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage ≥ grade 2 was significantly reduced [RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.93); RD -0.35 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.08); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2 to 13). Albuterol inhalation versus saline inhalation changed serum K+ from baseline at four hours [WMD -0.69 mmol/L (95% CI -0.87 to -0.51)] and at eight hours [WMD -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI -0.78 to -0.40)] after initiation of treatment. No differences noted in mortality or other clinical outcomes (Singh 2002). No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol inhalation. Other interventions listed in our objectives have not been studied to date. In view of the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality, no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made. It appears that the combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over treatment with rectal cation-resin for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants. Both the combination of insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study. The two interventions could possibly be tested against each other. The effectiveness of other potentially effective interventions for non-oliguric hyperkalaemia (diuretics, exchange transfusion, peritoneal dialysis and calcium) have not been tested in randomised controlled trials.","The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions for this serious condition. Two studies enrolling 52 infants that assessed the use of a combination of insulin and sugar to reduce the blood levels of potassium were identified. This combination reduced the duration of high blood levels of potassium and the risk for bleeds in the brains of the infants. One study that enrolled 19 patients reported on the use of albuterol (a medication that helps to move potassium from the blood to the body cells). Albuterol lowered the blood levels of potassium both at four and at eight hours after the treatment had started. Because of the few infants enrolled in the studies to date, no firm recommendations for the treatment of too high blood levels of potassium in neonates can be made. Further research is needed."
CD007142,"There were 15 trials with 11 included in the meta-analysis. Five trials showed relaxation reduced self-reported depression compared to wait-list, no treatment, or minimal treatment post intervention (SMD -0.59 (95% CI -0.94 to -0.24)). For clinician-rated depression, two trials showed a non-significant difference in the same direction (SMD -1.35 (95% CI -3.06 to 0.37)). Nine trials showed relaxation produced less effect than psychological (mainly cognitive-behavioural) treatment on self-reported depression (SMD = 0.38 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.62)). Three trials showed no significant difference between relaxation and psychological treatment on clinician-rated depression at post intervention (SMD 0.29 (95% CI -0.18 to 0.75)). Inconsistent effects were found when comparing relaxation training to medication and there were few data available comparing relaxation with complementary and lifestyle treatments. Relaxation techniques were more effective at reducing self-rated depressive symptoms than no or minimal treatment. However, they were not as effective as psychological treatment. Data on clinician-rated depressive symptoms were less conclusive. Further research is required to investigate the possibility of relaxation being used as a first-line treatment in a stepped care approach to managing depression, especially in younger populations and populations with subthreshold or first episodes of depression.","The review of 15 trials found that it was better than no treatment or minimal treatment, but not as effective as psychological therapies like cognitive-behaviour therapy. Relaxation techniques have potential as a simple first-line psychological treatment for depression. Those who do not respond within a set time could be offered more complex psychological treatment such as cognitive-behaviour therapy."
CD004435,"Seventeen studies (831 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All the studies had some shortcomings, such as small sample size, under-reporting of methods and data, and lack of blinding. OA versus control appliances (six studies): OA reduced daytime sleepiness in two crossover trials (ESS score -1.81; 95%CI -2.72 to -0.90), and improved apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) (-10.78 events/hr; 95% CI-15.53 to -6.03 parallel group data - five studies). OA versus CPAP (ten studies): There was no statistically significant difference in symptoms for either parallel or crossover studies, although OAs were less effective than CPAP in reducing apnoea-hypopnoea index in parallel and crossover studies. CPAP was more effective at improving minimum arterial oxygen saturation during sleep compared with OA. In two small crossover studies, participants preferred OA therapy to CPAP. OA versus corrective upper airway surgery (one study): Symptoms of daytime sleepiness were initially lower with surgery, but this difference disappeared at 12 months. AHI did not differ significantly initially, but did so after 12 months in favour of OA. There is increasing evidence suggesting that OA improves subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing compared with a control. CPAP appears to be more effective in improving sleep disordered breathing than OA. The difference in symptomatic response between these two treatments is not significant, although it is not possible to exclude an effect in favour of either therapy. Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of OA in relation to CPAP, with regard to symptoms and long-term complications, it would appear to be appropriate to recommend OA therapy to patients with mild symptomatic OSAH, and those patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate CPAP therapy. Future research should recruit patients with more severe symptoms of sleepiness, to establish whether the response to therapy differs between subgroups in terms of quality of life, symptoms and persistence with usage. Long-term data on cardiovascular health are required.","This review found that OA should not be considered as first choice therapy for OSAH, where symptoms and sleep disruption are severe. There has not been a sufficient amount of research that examines the effects of OA compared with CPAP in terms of symptoms and quality of life. Although CPAP was clearly more effective at reducing the disruption to sleep, some people with OSAH may prefer using them if they are found to be tolerable and more convenient than CPAP. When an active OA was compared with an inactive OA , there were improvements in daytime sleepiness and apnoea/hypopnoea severity. OA may be more effective than corrective upper airway surgery. Further research should consider whether people with more distinctly severe symptoms respond in a similar way to those patients represented in the studies we have included in the review."
CD013270,"We included 14 studies in the review; two RCTs, seven NRSs, and six economic evaluations (one study was both an NRS and economic evaluation). The studies reported on 276,260 participants (7384 for ISBCS and 268,876 for DSBCS) and were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Overall, we considered the included RCTs to be at 'high to some concerns' risk of bias for complications, 'some concerns' risk of bias for refractive outcomes and visual acuity, and 'high' risk of bias for PROMs. The overall risk of bias for NRSs was graded 'serious' regarding complications and 'serious to critical' regarding refractive outcomes. With regard to endophthalmitis, we found that relative effects were estimated imprecisely and with low certainty, so that relative estimates were not reliable. Nonetheless, we found a very low risk of endophthalmitis in both ISBCS (1/14,076 participants) and DSBCS (55/556,246 participants) groups. Based on descriptive evidence and partially weak statistical evidence we found no evidence of an increased risk of endophthalmitis with ISBCS. Regarding refractive outcomes, we found moderate-certainty (RCTs) and low-certainty (NRSs) evidence there was no difference in the percentage of eyes that did not achieve refraction within 1.0 dioptre of target one to three months after surgery (RCTs: risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.26; NRSs: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between groups (RCTs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.40; NRSs: 1.04, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.29), although the certainty of this evidence was very low for both RCTs and NRSs. Furthermore, we found low-certainty (RCTs) to very low-certainty (NRSs) evidence that total costs per participant were lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS, although results of individual studies could not be pooled. Only one study reported on cost-effectiveness. This study found that ISBCS is cost-effective compared to DSBCS, but did not measure quality-adjusted life years using preferred methods and calculated costs erroneously. Finally, regarding secondary outcomes, we found limited evidence on BCDVA (data of two RCTs could not be pooled, although both studies individually found no difference between groups (very low-certainty evidence)). Regarding PROMs, we found moderate-certainty evidence (RCTs only) that there was no difference between groups one to three months after surgery (standardised mean difference −0.08, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.03). Current evidence supports there are probably no clinically important differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS, but with lower costs for ISBCS. However, the amount of evidence is limited, and the certainty of the evidence was graded moderate to very low. In addition, there is a need for well-designed cost-effectiveness studies.","We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost-effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost-effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. - Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. - Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. - Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. - Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost-effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. - Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. - PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence). Our confidence is limited because:
- the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
- the studies assessed complications in different ways;
- there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
- studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources;
- the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results;
- there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes). The evidence is up-to-date to 11 May 2021."
CD005051,"We included nine RCTs randomising a total of 1414 participants (age range 24 to 70; mean age 45 to 59, where reported) to whole grain versus lower whole grain or refined grain control groups. We found no studies that reported the effect of whole grain diets on total cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events (total myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, total stroke). All included studies reported the effect of whole grain diets on risk factors for cardiovascular disease including blood lipids and blood pressure. All studies were in primary prevention populations and had an unclear or high risk of bias, and no studies had an intervention duration greater than 16 weeks. Overall, we found no difference between whole grain and control groups for total cholesterol (mean difference 0.07, 95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.21; 6 studies (7 comparisons); 722 participants; low-quality evidence). Using GRADE, we assessed the overall quality of the available evidence on cholesterol as low. Four studies were funded by independent national and government funding bodies, while the remaining studies reported funding or partial funding by organisations with commercial interests in cereals. There is insufficient evidence from RCTs of an effect of whole grain diets on cardiovascular outcomes or on major CVD risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Trials were at unclear or high risk of bias with small sample sizes and relatively short-term interventions, and the overall quality of the evidence was low. There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs with longer durations assessing cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular risk factors.","We evaluated nine randomised studies assessing the effects of whole grain diets compared to diets with refined grains or a usual diet on levels of cholesterol in the blood or blood pressure (major risk factors for cardiovascular disease including heart attacks or stroke). The evidence is current to August 2016. The diets were followed for at least 12 weeks, but most studies had some methodological limitations, numbers of participants were small, and the overall quality of the evidence was low. We found no studies reporting on the effect of whole grains on deaths from cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular events. All nine included studies reported the effects of whole grain diets on levels of cholesterol in the blood or blood pressure. We found no effects on blood cholesterol or blood pressure in favour of whole grain diets. Four studies were funded by independent national and government funding bodies, while the remaining studies reported funding or partial funding by organisations with commercial interests in cereals. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to date to recommend consumption of whole grain diets to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, or lower blood cholesterol, or blood pressure."
CD010085,"Eight trials involving 3366 women and their 3175 children were included in the review. In these trials, women were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA during pregnancy (five trials), lactation (two trials) or both pregnancy and lactation (one trial). All trials randomly allocated women to either a n-3 LCPUFA supplement or a control group. The risk of bias varied across the eight included trials in this review with only two trials with a low risk of selection, performance and attrition bias. N-3 LCPUFA supplementation showed a clear reduction in the primary outcome of any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE mediated) in children aged 12 to 36 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98; two RCTs; 823 children), but not beyond 36 months (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.20; one RCT, 706 children). For any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report), no clear differences were seen in children either at 12 to 36 months (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; two RCTs, 823 children) or beyond 36 months of age (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; three RCTs, 1765 children). For the secondary outcomes of specific allergies there were no clear differences for food allergies at 12 to 36 months and beyond 36 months, but a clear reduction was seen for children in their first 12 months with n-3 LCPUFA (both for medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report). There was a clear reduction in medically diagnosed IgE-mediated eczema with n-3 LCPUFA for children 12 to 36 months of age, but not at any other time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report. No clear differences for allergic rhinitis or asthma/wheeze were seen at any time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated, and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report. There was a clear reduction in children's sensitisation to egg and sensitisation to any allergen between 12 to 36 months of age when mothers were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA. In terms of safety for the mother and child, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy did not show increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage or early childhood infections. Overall, there is limited evidence to support maternal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and/or lactation for reducing allergic disease in children. Few differences in childhood allergic disease were seen between women who were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA and those who were not.","In this review of randomised controlled studies, we evaluated the effects of adding marine omega-3 fatty acids to women’s diets during pregnancy or lactation on allergic diseases in their children. We analysed eight trials that involved 3366 women and 3175 children. The women were randomly assigned to receive a marine omega-3 supplement (as fish oil capsules, or added to foods) or no treatment during pregnancy (five trials), during breast feeding (two trials) or both pregnancy and breast feeding (one trial). Overall, the methodological quality of the trials varied, with only two trials being at low risk of bias. Overall, the results showed little effect of maternal marine omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy and/or breast feeding for the reduction of allergic disease in the children. However there were reductions in some outcomes such as food allergy during the baby's first year and eczema with marine omega-3 supplementation in women with a baby at high risk of allergy. Currently, there is not enough evidence to say that omega-3 supplements from marine origin during pregnancy and/or breast feeding for mothers will reduce allergies in their children. In terms of safety for the mother and child, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation from marine origin during pregnancy did not show increased risk of excessive bleeding after the baby was born (postpartum haemorrhage) or early childhood infections."
CD008470,"Three randomised controlled trials and one quasi-randomised controlled trial were included. These involved a total of 292 participants with ankle fractures. All studies were at high risk of bias from lack of blinding. Additionally, loss to follow-up or inappropriate exclusion of participants put two trials at high risk of attrition bias. The trials used different and incompatible outcome measures for assessing function and pain. Only limited meta-analysis was possible for early treatment failure, some adverse events and radiological signs of arthritis. One trial, following up 92 of 111 randomised participants, found no statistically significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient-reported symptoms (self assessed ankle ""troubles"": 11/43 versus 14/49; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.76) or walking difficulties at seven years follow-up. One trial, reporting data for 31 of 43 randomised participants, found a statistically significantly better mean Olerud score in the surgically treated group but no difference between the two groups in pain scores after a mean follow-up of 27 months. A third trial, reporting data for 49 of 96 randomised participants at 3.5 years follow-up, reported no difference between the two groups in a non-validated clinical score. Early treatment failure, generally reflecting the failure of closed reduction (criteria not reported in two trials) probably or explicitly leading to surgery in patients allocated conservative treatment, was significantly higher in the conservative treatment group (2/116 versus 19/129; RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications. Pooled results from two trials of participants with radiological signs of osteoarthritis at averages of 3.5 and 7.0 years follow-up showed no between-group differences (44/66 versus 50/75; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31). There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude whether surgical or conservative treatment produces superior long-term outcomes for ankle fractures in adults. The identification of several ongoing randomised trials means that better evidence to inform this question is likely to be available in future.","This review included four trials, involving a total of 292 participants. All four trials had flawed methods that could affect the reliability of their findings. No data could be pooled for long-term measures of function or pain. The largest trial found no evidence of differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient-reported symptoms or walking difficulties at seven years follow-up. The second trial found better results for the surgical group for function but not pain at 27 months, while the third trial reported no difference between the two groups in clinical outcome at 3.5 years. In all four trials, there were some patients in the conservative treatment group who were treated surgically because the repositioning of the fractured bone was judged unsuccessful. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications nor in radiological signs of osteoarthritis. Overall, there was not enough reliable evidence to draw conclusions about whether surgery or conservative treatment is more appropriate for treating broken ankles in adults."
CD003160,"We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.","We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. We found two suitable randomised trials for inclusion in this review with 26,340 participants; neither showed any reduction in occurrence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in people treated with statins compared to people given placebo. Side effects were low in both statin and placebo groups with no difference between groups in the risk of dropping out of the trial due to side effects. There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia."
CD007676,"Four studies, involving a total of 414 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents. The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years. The trials lasted between two months and 12 months. The interventions were based on Pennebaker's method. The risk of bias across most domains of the studies was generally considered to be low, however three of four studies were considered at high risk of bias due to lack of assessor blinding and one study was at high risk of bias for selective reporting. The interpretation of these studies was limited by diverse outcome measurements, measurement tools, control group techniques, and number and/or times of follow-up. A pooled result from the four studies, including a total of 146 intervention and 135 control participants, indicated uncertain effect in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted between the disclosure group and the control group (mean difference (MD) 3.43%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.61% to 7.47%; very low-quality evidence) at ≤ three months' follow-up. Similarly, evidence from two studies indicated that written emotional disclosure found uncertain effect on forced vital capacity (FVC) (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.26; low-quality evidence) and asthma symptoms (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.09; low-quality evidence) but may result in improved asthma control at ≤ three months' follow-up (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.58; low-quality evidence). We were unable to pool the data for other outcomes. Results from individual trials did not reveal a significant benefit of written emotional disclosure for quality of life, medication use, healthcare utilisation or psychological well-being. Evidence from one trial suggests a significant reduction in beta agonist use (MD -1.62, 95% CI -2.62 to -0.62; low-quality evidence) at ≤ three months' follow-up in the disclosure group compared with controls. The review did not address any adverse effects of emotional writing. Evidence was insufficient to show whether written emotional disclosure compared with writing about non-emotional topics had an effect on the outcomes included in this review. Evidence is insufficient to allow any conclusions as to the role of disclosure in quality of life, psychological well-being, medication use and healthcare utilisation. The evidence presented in this review is generally of low quality. Better designed studies with standardised reporting of outcome measurement instruments are required to determine the effectiveness of written emotional disclosure in the management of asthma.","Four studies, involving 414 participants, were included in this review. The trials lasted between two months and 12 months. One study was conducted in the UK, the other three in the USA. All studies compared emotional disclosure writing versus non-stressful writing. Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents. The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years. In all trials, most of the participants were female. There is no evidence to support that written emotional disclosure is helpful in improving lung function or symptoms in patients with asthma. However, disclosure may be beneficial for patients' perceptions of their own asthma control. Based on evidence obtained from the studies, we are not able to draw conclusions about the role of written emotional disclosure in quality of life, psychological well-being, asthma medication use or use of healthcare facilities for asthma-related problems. Better designed studies are necessary to determine the effects of written emotional disclosure for patients with asthma. Our interpretation of the studies was limited by variation in study settings, topics of the non-stressful writing exercise and study duration. The evidence presented in this review is generally of low quality. This summary was current to January 2014."
CD009345,"We included 18 RCTs, which were reported in 17 publications (one publication reports on two trials) with 4342 participants (of which 212 were children) suffering from the common cold, both naturally occurring and experimentally induced. The interventions consisted of an antihistamine as monotherapy compared with placebo. In adults there was a short-term beneficial effect of antihistamines on severity of overall symptoms: on day one or two of treatment 45% had a beneficial effect with antihistamines versus 38% with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92). However, there was no difference between antihistamines and placebo in the mid term (three to four days) to long term (six to 10 days). When evaluating individual symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, there was some beneficial effect of the sedating antihistamines compared to placebo (e.g. rhinorrhoea on day three: mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.06 on a four- or five-point severity scale; sneezing on day three: MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.20 on a four-point severity scale), but this effect is clinically non-significant. Adverse events such as sedation were more commonly reported with sedating antihistamines although the differences were not statistically significant. Only two trials included children and the results were conflicting. The majority of the trials had a low risk of bias although some lacked sufficient trial quality information. Antihistamines have a limited short-term (days one and two of treatment) beneficial effect on severity of overall symptoms but not in the mid to long term. There is no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea or sneezing. Although side effects are more common with sedating antihistamines, the difference is not statistically significant. There is no evidence of effectiveness of antihistamines in children.","The evidence is current to August 2015. The participants were adults or children with a common cold. We excluded studies with participants suffering from hay fever, asthma or eczema. The effect of different antihistamines was compared to placebo. A beneficial effect meant a decrease in the severity or duration of the general feeling of illness and/or of specific symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose or sneezing. We also investigated whether side effects were more common with antihistamines than placebo. As the common cold usually resolves in seven to 10 days, most studies were of short duration. Where possible we studied the immediate effect and the effect after six to 10 days. Most studies were of good quality although in some studies information to allow us to assess quality was lacking. We considered five out of 16 adults studies and one out of two paediatric studies to be of excellent quality. All trials outlined the financial support received from pharmaceutical companies in the form of grants, supplying the respective intervention drug or having an author currently employed by a pharmaceutical company. In adults, there is a short-term beneficial effect on severity of overall symptoms on the first or second day of treatment (45% felt better versus 38% with placebo), but there was no difference between antihistamines and placebo in the mid to long term. The effect of sedating antihistamines on rhinorrhoea and sneezing is too small to be relevant to the patient and involves a risk of side effects such as sedation (9% versus 5.2% with placebo). Trials in children were smaller and of lower quality and lacked evidence of effectiveness."
CD011747,"We included 17 RCTs (9975 participants, mean age 63.3 years). We found very limited (or no) data to inform most planned comparisons. Summary data were used to inform comparison of ranolazine versus placebo. Overall, risk of bias was assessed as unclear. For add-on ranolazine compared to placebo, no data were available to estimate cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. We found uncertainty about the effect of ranolazine on: all-cause mortality (1000 mg twice daily, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.71; 3 studies, 2053 participants; low quality evidence); quality of life (any dose, SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.52; 4 studies, 1563 participants; I² = 73%; moderate quality evidence); and incidence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (1000mg twice daily, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1509 participants; low quality evidence). Add-on ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily reduced the fervour of angina episodes (MD -0.66, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.35; 3 studies, 2004 participants; I² = 39%; moderate quality evidence) but increased the risk of non-serious adverse events (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40; 3 studies, 2053 participants; moderate quality evidence). For ranolazine as monotherapy compared to placebo, we found uncertain effect on cardiovascular mortality (1000 mg twice daily, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.88; 1 study, 2604 participants; low quality evidence). No data were available to estimate non-cardiovascular mortality. We also found an uncertain effect on all-cause mortality for ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 3 studies, 6249 participants; low quality evidence), quality of life (1000 mg twice daily, MD 0.28, 95% CI -1.57 to 2.13; 3 studies, 2254 participants; moderate quality evidence), non-fatal AMI incidence (any dose, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 3 studies, 2983 participants; I² = 50%; low quality evidence), and frequency of angina episodes (any dose, MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.85 to 1.01; 2 studies, 402 participants; low quality evidence). We found an increased risk for non-serious adverse events associated with ranolazine (any dose, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.00; 3 studies, 947 participants; very low quality evidence). We found very low quality evidence showing that people with stable angina who received ranolazine as monotherapy had increased risk of presenting non-serious adverse events compared to those given placebo. We found low quality evidence indicating that people with stable angina who received ranolazine showed uncertain effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (for ranolazine given as monotherapy), all-cause death and non-fatal AMI, and the frequency of angina episodes (for ranolazine given as monotherapy) compared to those given placebo. Moderate quality evidence indicated that people with stable angina who received ranolazine showed uncertain effect on quality of life compared with people who received placebo. Moderate quality evidence also indicated that people with stable angina who received ranolazine as add-on therapy had fewer angina episodes but increased risk of presenting non-serious adverse events compared to those given placebo.","We included 17 studies that involved a total of 9975 adult participants and lasted between 1 and 92 weeks. We only compared ranolazine and placebo because there were few data for other comparisons. The evidence was uncertain about the effect of ranolazine 1000 mg given alone twice daily to people with stable angina pectoris on the chance of dying from heart-related causes. There was no evidence about whether ranolazine changed the risk of dying from causes that were not heart-related. Although the evidence was uncertain about the effect of ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily on the chance of dying from any cause, quality of life, the possibility of heart attack or the frequency of angina attacks (for ranolazine taken alone), ranolazine did modestly reduce the numbers of angina attacks per week when given with other anti-angina drugs. Ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily increased the risk for experiencing dizziness, nausea and constipation from taking the drug (mild adverse events). Overall, evidence quality was assessed as very low for the chance of mild adverse events (for people who took ranolazine alone). Evidence was also low for estimating the chance of death from heart-related (when ranolazine is taken alone) or any causes, having a heart attack, and how often angina attacks occur (when ranolazine is taken alone). We found moderate quality evidence about quality of life, frequency of angina attacks and the chance of experiencing mild adverse events (for people who took ranolazine together with other anti-angina drugs),
Low evidence quality related to problems and reporting of study methods and too few data to calculate precise estimates."
CD007231,"In this updated review, we included seven completed RCTs with 401 participants. All tested adult human non-neural stem cells; cells were transplanted during the acute, subacute, or chronic phase of ischemic stroke; administered intravenously, intra-arterially, intracerebrally, or into the lumbar subarachnoid space. Follow-up ranged from six months to seven years. Efficacy outcomes were measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), or Barthel Index (BI). Safety outcomes included case fatality, and were measured at the end of the trial. Overall, stem cell transplantation was associated with a better clinical outcome when measured with the NIHSS (mean difference [MD] -1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.65 to -0.33; five studies, 319 participants; low-certainty evidence), but not with the mRS (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.02; six studies, 371 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or the BI (MD 14.09, 95% CI -1.94 to 30.13; three studies, 170 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The studies in favor of stem cell transplantation had, on average, a higher risk of bias, and a sample size of 32 or fewer participants. No significant safety concerns associated with stem cell transplantation were raised with respect to death (risk ratio [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.14; six studies, participants; low-certainty evidence). We were not able to perform the sensitivity analysis according to the quality of studies, because all of them were at high risk of bias. Overall, in participants with ischemic stroke, stem cell transplantation was associated with a reduced neurological impairment, but not with a better functional outcome. No obvious safety concerns were raised. However, these conclusions came mostly from small RCTs with high risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low. More well-designed trials are needed.","We included randomized trials that recruited adults with ischemic stroke, at any time after onset. We included any kind of stem cell or method of administration. We identified seven randomized trials, involving 401 participants. Overall, stem cell transplantation was associated with a reduced neurological impairment, but not with a better functional outcome. No safety concerns were raised. The certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low because of the risk of bias in the included studies, the lack of precision of the results, and different designs. More well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed."
CD007535,"We included eight RCTs with 609 participants. The comparisons in the included trials were as follows: CHM versus clomiphene, CHM plus clomiphene versus clomiphene (with or without ethinyloestradiol cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA)), CHM plus follicle aspiration plus ovulation induction versus follicle aspiration plus ovulation induction alone, and CHM plus laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) versus LOD alone. The overall certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was very low. None of the included studies reported the primary outcome, live birth rate. Most studies reported the secondary outcomes, and only one study reported data on adverse events. In trials that compared CHM to clomiphene (with or without LOD in both study arms), we are uncertain of the effect of CHM on pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 3.19; I2 = 28%; 3 studies, 140 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following clomiphene is assumed to be 21.5%, the chance following CHM would vary between 14.7% and 46.7%. No study reported data on adverse events. When CHM plus clomiphene was compared to clomiphene (with or without EE/CPA), there was low certainty evidence of a higher pregnancy rate in the CHM plus clomiphene group (OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.55; I2 = 10%; 6 studies, 470 participants; low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following clomiphene is assumed to be 31.5%, the chance following CHM plus clomiphene would vary between 48.5% and 67.7%. No data were reported on adverse events. In trials that compared CHM plus follicle aspiration and ovulation induction to follicle aspiration and ovulation induction alone, we are uncertain of the effect of CHM on pregnancy rates (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 5.68; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following follicle aspiration and ovulation induction is assumed to be 29.2%, the chance following CHM with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction would vary between 15.9% and 70%. Reported adverse events included severe luteinised unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) (Peto OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 8.19; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence) or multiple pregnancy (Peto OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence). These results suggest that if the chances of LUFS, OHSS, and multiple pregnancy following follicle aspiration and ovulation induction are assumed to be 8.3%, 4.2%, and 8.3% respectively, the chances following CHM with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction would be 0.5% to 35.8%, 0% to 26.3% and 0.5% to 35.8% respectively. In trials that compared CHM plus LOD to LOD alone, we are uncertain if CHM improves pregnancy rates (OR 3.50, 95% CI 0.72 to 17.09; 1 study, 30 women; very low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following LOD is assumed to be 40%, the chance following CHM with LOD would vary between 32.4% and 91.9%. No data were reported on adverse events. We are uncertain of the results in the comparison groups for all outcomes. The certainty of the evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was very low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or adverse events, failure to describe study methods in adequate detail and imprecision due to very low event rates and wide CIs. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CHM for subfertile women with PCOS. No data are available on live birth. We are uncertain of the effect of CHM on pregnancy rates for there is no consistent evidence to indicate that CHM influences fertility outcomes. However, we find that the addition of CHM to clomiphene may improve pregnancy rates, but there is very limited, low certainty evidence for this outcome. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence on adverse effects to indicate whether CHM is safe. In the future, well-designed, carefully conducted RCTs are needed, with a particular focus on the live birth rate and other safety indexes.","We searched for evidence in commonly used databases. The evidence is current to June 2020. We included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 609 participants (three new RCTs with 195 women in this updated review). These included studies comparing CHM to western medicine, CHM plus western medicine versus western medicine, and CHM plus surgery versus surgery. Seven of the included studies were conducted and published in Chinese, and the remaining one was in English. All studies had fewer than six menstrual cycles' treatment duration and less than one year follow-up duration. None of the included studies reported live birth, all reported pregnancy, two reported ovulation and only one reported adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of CHM for subfertile women with PCOS. No data were available on live birth. There was no consistent evidence to indicate that CHM improves fertility outcomes. When CHM was compared to clomiphene (with or without laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in both study arms), the pregnancy rates were no different between the treatment and control groups. When CHM plus follicle aspiration and ovulation induction was compared to follicle aspiration and ovulation induction alone, pregnancy rates were no different between the groups. When CHM plus LOD was compared to LOD alone, pregnancy rates were no different between the groups. The certainty of the evidence was very low and therefore we could not draw any conclusions about the results. There was, however, limited low certainty evidence to suggest that the addition of CHM to clomiphene may improve pregnancy rates. Due to the very low certainty evidence for all comparison groups for all outcomes, we were unable to draw conclusions. There was insufficient evidence on adverse effects to indicate whether CHM is safe. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or adverse events, failure to describe study methods in adequate detail, and imprecision, with very low event rates and wide confidence intervals."
CD007113,"We included one trial of 167 women and their babies. This trial was a pilot study recruiting alongside another study, therefore, a separate sample size was not calculated. The trial compared a twice-weekly surveillance regimen (biophysical profile, nonstress tests, umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery Doppler and uterine artery Doppler) with the same regimen applied fortnightly (both groups had growth assessed fortnightly). There were insufficient data to assess this review's primary infant outcome of composite perinatal mortality and serious morbidity (although there were no perinatal deaths) and no difference was seen in the primary maternal outcome of emergency caesarean section for fetal distress (risk ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 2.63). In keeping with the more frequent monitoring, mean gestational age at birth was four days less for the twice-weekly surveillance group compared with the fortnightly surveillance group (mean difference (MD) -4.00; 95% CI -7.79 to -0.21). Women in the twice-weekly surveillance group were 25% more likely to have induction of labour than those in the fortnightly surveillance group (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.50). There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform best practice for fetal surveillance regimens when caring for women with pregnancies affected by impaired fetal growth. More studies are needed to evaluate the effects of currently used fetal surveillance regimens in impaired fetal growth.","The review authors identified only one controlled trial, from New Zealand. This trial randomised 167 women who were between 24 and 36 weeks' pregnant where ultrasound showed a small-for-gestational-age baby. They received a set combination of tests either twice-weekly or fortnightly. With more frequent testing, women were 25% more likely to have induced labour. Overall their babies were born four days earlier than in the fortnightly surveillance group where spontaneous onset of labour was more likely to occur. The mean gestational age at birth was just under 38 weeks in the twice-weekly group and just over 38 weeks in the fortnightly group, which was unlikely to have an impact on the health of the newborn. The number of caesarean sections, either for fetal distress or because of failure of induction, was no different. No information was available on length of antenatal hospital admission or operative vaginal births and infants were not followed up to determine neurodevelopment and cerebral palsy. This study excluded pregnancies with abnormal Doppler studies and disorders of the amniotic fluid. More studies are needed and the women’s views on the testing are also important."
CD014908,"We included three comparative NRSIs with 314,704 participants total and two case series describing 13 patients. The three NRSIs had serious to critical risk of bias in several domains and low study quality. Only one NRSI ascertained current use of contraceptives based on patient report; the other two used diagnostic codes within medical records to assess hormonal contraception use, but did not confirm current use nor indication for use. None of the NRSIs included thromboembolism as an outcome. Studies were not similar enough in terms of their outcomes, interventions, and study populations to combine with meta-analyses. We therefore narratively synthesized all included studies. Based on results from one NRSI, there may be little to no effect of combined hormonal contraception use on odds of mortality for COVID-19 positive patients (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; 1 study, 18,892 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two NRSIs examined hospitalization rates for hormonal contraception users versus non-users. Based on results from one NRSI, the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 positive combined hormonal contraception users may be slightly decreased compared with non-users for patients with BMI under 35 kg/m2 (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97; 1 study, 295,689 participants; very low-certainty evidence). According to results of the other NRSI assessing use of any type of hormonal contraception, there may be little to no effect on hospitalization rates for COVID-19 positive individuals (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.44; 1 study, 123 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We included two case series because no comparative studies directly assessed thromboembolism as an outcome. In a case series of six pediatric COVID-19 positive patients with pulmonary embolism, one (older than 15 years of age) was using combined hormonal contraception. In a second case series of seven COVID-19 positive patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, one was using oral contraceptives. One comparative study and one case series reported on intubation rates, but the evidence for both is very uncertain. In the comparative study of 123 COVID-19 positive patients (N = 44 using hormonal contraception and N = 79 not using hormonal contraception), no patients in either group required intubation. In the case series of seven individuals with cerebral venous thromboembolism, one oral contraceptive user and one non-user required intubation. There are no comparative studies assessing risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients who use hormonal contraception, which was the primary objective of this review. Very little evidence exists examining the risk of increased COVID-19 disease severity for combined hormonal contraception users compared to non-users of hormonal contraception, and the evidence that does exist is of very low certainty. The odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 positive users of combined hormonal contraceptives may be slightly decreased compared with those of hormonal contraceptive non-users, but the evidence is very uncertain as this is based on one study restricted to patients with BMI under 35 kg/m2. There may be little to no effect of combined hormonal contraception use on odds of intubation or mortality among COVID-19 positive patients, and little to no effect of using any type of hormonal contraception on odds of hospitalization and intubation for COVID-19 patients. We noted no large effect for risk of increased COVID-19 disease severity among hormonal contraception users. We specifically noted gaps in pertinent data collection regarding hormonal contraception use such as formulation, hormone doses, and duration or timing of contraceptive use. Differing estrogens may have different thrombogenic potential given differing potency, so it would be important to know if a formulation contained, for example, ethinyl estradiol versus estradiol valerate. Additionally, we downgraded several studies for risk of bias because information on the timing of contraceptive use relative to COVID-19 infection and method adherence were not ascertained. No studies reported indication for hormonal contraceptive use, which is important as individuals who use hormonal management for medical conditions like heavy menstrual bleeding might have different risk profiles compared to individuals using hormones for contraception. Future studies should focus on including pertinent confounders like age, obesity, history of prior venous thromboembolism, risk factors for venous thromboembolism, and recent pregnancy.","We included studies published up to March 2022. We looked for studies that reported on risk of developing blood clots, being hospitalized, needing high levels of care like requiring a breathing tube, or risk of dying from COVID-19 for people who used birth control, especially birth control with estrogen like combined pills, compared to people who did not use birth control. Because there were very few studies, we also looked at studies that reported on a group of individuals with COVID-19 using birth control who developed clots who were not compared to another group. We included five studies in total. One study of 18,892 people looked at the risk of dying for people with COVID-19 using combined birth control methods. Another study of 295,689 people looked at the risk of being hospitalized for people using combined birth control methods who were tracking their COVID symptoms on a smartphone application, but not specifically tested for COVID-19. A third study of only 123 people looked at the risk of being hospitalized for people with COVID-19 who were using any type of hormonal birth control. Finally, two studies of 13 people total with COVID-19 who had developed blood clots looked at the number of those people who had used combined birth control. One study reported similar risks of dying from COVID-19 among people using combined hormonal birth control and those people not using it, but the evidence was very uncertain. Based on results from one study, there may be a slightly decreased risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 for people who use combined hormonal birth control, but the evidence was very uncertain. Results from a smaller study found that there may be little to no effect of using any type of hormonal birth control on risk of hospitalization for people with COVID-19 disease, but the evidence was very uncertain. Using hormonal birth control may have little to no effect on risk of needing a breathing tube for people with COVID-19 disease, but the evidence is very uncertain. Reports describing a series of 13 women and girls with COVID-19 that had blood clots found that two of the people used combined hormonal birth control. We did not find any evidence on risk of heart attack or stroke for users of hormonal birth control with COVID-19 disease. We did not find any evidence for any outcome for people with COVID-19 using combined hormonal birth control as compared to those using birth control containing progestin hormone only. Overall there were few studies we were able to include and they all had serious design issues that made it very difficult to interpret the evidence. The evidence was very uncertain about the risk of clotting-related harms for people with COVID-19 who use hormonal birth control. There may be similar or reduced risk of being hospitalized for people who use hormonal contraception. We have little to no confidence in the evidence base because the studies did not provide important information we were interested in, such as reasons people may be at risk for developing blood clots. The studies also did not include the exact types of people we were looking for, like people who had COVID-19 that was confirmed with a test or people who were confirmed to be taking birth control when they had COVID-19. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results."
CD013020,"Twenty-five trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Twenty-one trials could be considered in the quantitative analysis, of which six bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, risedronate, pamidronate, alendronate, etidronate, or clodronate) were compared with each other, the RANKL-inhibitor denosumab, or no treatment/placebo. By conducting network meta-analysis we were able to compare all of these reported agents directly and/or indirectly within the network for each outcome. In the abstract only the comparisons of zoledronic acid and denosumab against the main comparator (no treatment/placebo) are described for outcomes that were predefined as most relevant and that also appear in the 'Summary of findings' table. Other results, as well as results of subgroup analyses regarding castration status of participants, are displayed in the Results section of the full text. Treatment with zoledronic acid probably neither reduces nor increases the proportion of participants with pain response when compared to no treatment/placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 2.32; per 1000 participants 121 more (19 less to 349 more); moderate-certainty evidence; network based on 4 trials including 1013 participants). For this outcome none of the trials reported results for the comparison with denosumab. The adverse event renal impairment probably occurs more often when treated with zoledronic acid compared to no treatment/placebo (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.45; per 1000 participants 78 more (10 more to 180 more); moderate-certainty evidence; network based on 6 trials including 1769 participants). Results for denosumab could not be included for this outcome, since zero events cannot be considered in the network meta-analysis, therefore it does not appear in the ranking. Treatment with denosumab results in increased occurrence of the adverse event ONJ (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.06 to 11.24; per 1000 participants 30 more (1 more to 125 more); high-certainty evidence; 4 trials, 3006 participants) compared to no treatment/placebo. When comparing zoledronic acid to no treatment/placebo, the confidence intervals include the possibility of benefit or harm, therefore treatment with zoledronic acid probably neither reduces nor increases ONJ (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.87; per 1000 participants 11 more (3 less to 47 more); moderate-certainty evidence; network based on 4 trials including 3006 participants). Compared to no treatment/placebo, treatment with zoledronic acid (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and denosumab (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.96) may result in a reduction of the total number of SREs (per 1000 participants 75 fewer (131 fewer to 14 fewer) and 131 fewer (215 fewer to 19 fewer); both low-certainty evidence; 12 trials, 5240 participants). Treatment with zoledronic acid and denosumab likely neither reduces nor increases mortality when compared to no treatment/placebo (zoledronic acid RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; per 1000 participants 48 fewer (97 fewer to 5 more); denosumab RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; per 1000 participants 34 fewer (111 fewer to 54 more); both moderate-certainty evidence; 13 trials, 5494 participants). Due to insufficient reporting, no network meta-analysis was possible for the outcome quality of life. One study with 1904 participants comparing zoledronic acid and denosumab showed that more zoledronic acid-treated participants than denosumab-treated participants experienced a greater than or equal to five-point decrease in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General total scores over a range of 18 months (average relative difference = 6.8%, range −9.4% to 14.6%) or worsening of cancer-related quality of life. When considering bone-modifying agents as supportive treatment, one has to balance between efficacy and acceptability. Results suggest that Zoledronic acid likely increases both the proportion of participants with pain response, and the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events However, more trials with head-to-head comparisons including all potential agents are needed to draw the whole picture and proof the results of this analysis.","We conducted thorough searches in various databases until 23 March 2020. We included 25 studies comparing different bone-modifying agents with each other or against no further treatment or placebo treatment (dummy treatment) in men with prostate cancer and bone metastases. Twenty-one of the 25 included studies reported data for our predefined patient-relevant outcomes. A total of seven different agents were included, six bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, risedronate, pamidronate, alendronate, etidronate, and clodronate) and one other agent, denosumab. Analysis was only possible for each outcome of interest separately. Considering skeletal-related events, zoledronic acid and denosumab appeared to be the most effective, but also seemed to cause the most and worst adverse events (like renal impairment for treatment with zoledronic acid and osteonecrosis of the jaw for denosumab). Most of the included studies did not report data on quality of life or reported it very poorly, so that we could not analyse this outcome combining the information from different studies. The results were therefore described with words. We rated the certainty of the evidence as high to low for the different agents and outcomes. A limitation of this review is that an overall ranking considering all outcomes at the same time is not possible. In order to make an informed decision about which treatment option should be used, one therefore must look at all the outcomes of interest and balance the pros and cons of each option."
CD005111,"Seventeen RCTs (1806 participants) were included. Five RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. The risk of bias in these studies was low. We found no evidence of an improvement with acupuncture relative to sham (placebo) acupuncture for symptom severity (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.13; 4 RCTs; 281 patients) or quality of life (SMD = -0.03, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.22; 3 RCTs; 253 patients). Sensitivity analyses based on study quality did not change the results. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes in the sham controlled trials was moderate due to sparse data. The risk of bias in the four Chinese language comparative effectiveness trials that compared acupuncture with drug treatment was high due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias in the other studies that did not use a sham control was high due to lack of blinding or inadequate methods used for randomization and allocation concealment or both. Acupuncture was significantly more effective than pharmacological therapy and no specific treatment. Eighty-four per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 63% of patients in the pharmacological treatment group (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45; 5 studies, 449 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to a high risk of bias (no blinding) and sparse data. Sixty-three per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 34% of patients in the no specific therapy group (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.79; 2 studies, 181 patients). There was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and Bifidobacterium (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.27; 2 studies; 181 patients) or between acupuncture and psychotherapy (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.26; 1 study; 100 patients). Acupuncture as an adjuvant to another Chinese medicine treatment was significantly better than the other treatment alone. Ninety-three per cent of patients in the adjuvant acupuncture group improved compared to 79% of patients who received Chinese medicine alone (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33; 4 studies; 466 patients). There was one adverse event (i.e. acupuncture syncope) associated with acupuncture in the 9 trials that reported this outcome, although relatively small sample sizes limit the usefulness of these safety data. Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of acupuncture relative to a credible sham acupuncture control for IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life. In comparative effectiveness Chinese trials, patients reported greater benefits from acupuncture than from two antispasmodic drugs (pinaverium bromide and trimebutine maleate), both of which have been shown to provide a modest benefit for IBS. Future trials may help clarify whether or not these reportedly greater benefits of acupuncture relative to pharmacological therapies are due entirely to patients’ preferences for acupuncture or greater expectations of improvement on acupuncture relative to drug therapy.","This review included 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including a total of 1806 participants. Five RCTs (411 participants) compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture for the treatment of IBS. Sham acupuncture is a procedure in which the patient believes he or she is receiving true acupuncture. However, in sham acupuncture the needles either do not penetrate the skin or are not placed at the correct places on the body, or both. Sham acupuncture is intended to be a placebo for true acupuncture. The sham-controlled studies were well designed and of high methodological quality. These studies tested the effects of acupuncture on IBS symptom severity or health-related quality of life. None of these RCTs found acupuncture to be better than sham acupuncture for either of these two outcomes, and pooling the results of these RCTs also did not show acupuncture to be better than sham acupuncture. Evidence from four Chinese language comparative effectiveness trials showed acupuncture to be superior to two antispasmodic drugs (pinaverium bromide and trimebutine maleate), both of which provide a modest benefit for the treatment of IBS, although neither is approved for treatment of IBS in the United States. It is unclear whether or not the greater benefits of acupuncture reported by patients in these unblinded studies are due entirely to patients’ greater expectations of improvement from acupuncture than drugs or preference for acupuncture over drug therapy. There was one side effect (i.e. fainting in one patient) associated with acupuncture in the nine trials that reported side effects, although relatively small sample sizes limit the usefulness of this safety data."
CD011804,"We included a total of four studies with 296 participants. Three studies with 206 participants compared quetiapine, an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic, with placebo. One study used a cross-over design and two studies a parallel-group design. Study duration was eight or 12 weeks. Quetiapine was used in all studies with a bedtime dosage between 50 and 300 mg/day. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias and we judged them to be at moderate risk of bias overall. The primary outcomes in this review were participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved, withdrawal due to adverse events (tolerability) and serious adverse events (safety). Second tier evidence indicated that quetiapine was not statistically superior to placebo in the number of participants with a 50% or more pain reduction (very low quality evidence). No study reported data on PGIC. A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a 30% or more pain reduction (risk difference (RD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.23; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 8, 95% CI 5 to 100) (very low quality evidence). A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a clinically relevant improvement of health-related quality of life compared to placebo ( RD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 20) (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing sleep problems (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.67, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.23), depression (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.04) and anxiety (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.11) (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing the risk of withdrawing from the study due to a lack of efficacy (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.05) (very low quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawing due to adverse events (tolerability) (very low quality evidence), in the frequency of serious adverse events (safety) (very low quality evidence) and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness and somnolence as an adverse event (very low quality evidence). In more participants in the quetiapine group a substantial weight gain was noted (RD 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.15; number needed to treat for an additional harm (NNTH) 12, 95% CI 6 to 50) (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels to a very low quality rating because of limitations of study design, indirectness (patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded) and imprecision (fewer than 400 patients were analysed). One parallel design study with 90 participants compared quetiapine (50 to 300 mg/day flexible at bedtime) to amitriptyline (10 to 75 mg/day flexible at bedtime). The study had three major risks of bias and we judged it to be at moderate risk of bias overall. We downgraded the quality of evidence by two levels to a low quality rating because of indirectness (patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded) and imprecision (fewer than 400 patients were analysed). Third tier evidence indicated no statistically significant differences between the two drugs. Both drugs did not statistically significantly differ in the reduction of average scores for pain, fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and for limitations of health-related quality of life and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness, somnolence and weight gain as a side effect (low quality evidence). Compared to amitriptyline, more participants left the study due to adverse events (low quality evidence). No serious adverse events were reported (low quality evidence). We found no relevant study with other antipsychotics than quetiapine in fibromyalgia. Very low quality evidence suggests that quetiapine may be considered for a time-limited trial (4 to 12 weeks) to reduce pain, sleep problems, depression and anxiety in fibromyalgia patients with major depression. Potential side effects such as weight gain should be balanced against the potential benefits in shared decision making with the patient.","In May 2016, we searched for clinical trials in which antipsychotics were used to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. We found a total of four studies with 298 participants. We found three studies with 208 participants, which were eight and 12 weeks long and compared quetiapine, an antipsychotic, against a fake medication (placebo). One hundred and sixty-six participants were diagnosed with major depression. We also found one study comprising 90 patients that compared quetiapine to an antidepressant named amitriptyline, which is frequently used in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Five people in this study were diagnosed with major depression. Quetiapine was not better than a fake medication in achieving a pain reduction of 50% or more (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was better than the fake medication in achieving a pain reduction of 30% or more, reducing sleep problems, and improving depressed mood and anxiety (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was better than the fake medication in improving health-related quality of life. Fewer participants dropped out of the trial due to lack of efficacy with quetiapine than with fake medication (very low quality evidence). There was no difference in tolerability and safety between quetiapine and a fake medication (very low quality evidence). For some people, quetiapine led to substantial weight gain and somnolence (sleepiness). Quetiapine and amitriptyline (an antidepressant which is frequently used to improve sleep and reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia) did not differ in the reduction of average scores for pain, fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and for limitations of health-related quality of life. Both drugs did not differ in the proportion of patients reporting dizziness, somnolence and weight gain as a side effect (low quality evidence). Compared with amitriptyline, more people experienced side effects and left the study due to side effects with quetiapine (low quality evidence). No serious side effects with either drug were reported (low quality evidence). We found no relevant study with other antipsychotics than quetiapine in fibromyalgia."
CD006751,"No studies of vitamin A or other retinoid supplementation were eligible for inclusion. However, one randomised study of beta (β)-carotene supplementation involving 24 people with CF who were receiving pancreatic enzyme substitution was included. The study compared successive β-carotene supplementation periods (high dose followed by low dose) compared to placebo. The results for the low-dose supplementation period should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of a wash-out period after the high-dose supplementation. The included study did not report on two of the review's primary outcomes (vitamin A deficiency disorders and mortality); results for our third primary outcome of growth and nutritional status (reported as z score for height) showed no difference between supplementation and placebo, mean difference (MD) -0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.89 to 0.43) (low-quality evidence). With regards to secondary outcomes, supplementation with high-dose β-carotene for three months led to significantly fewer days of systemic antibiotics required to treat pulmonary exacerbations, compared to controls, MD -15 days (95% CI -27.60 to -2.40); however, this was not maintained in the second three-month section of the study when the level of β-carotene supplementation was reduced, MD -8 days (95% CI -18.80 to 2.80) (low-quality evidence). There were no statistically significant effects between groups in lung function (low-quality evidence) and no adverse events were observed (low-quality evidence). Supplementation affected levels of β-carotene in plasma, but not vitamin A levels. The study did not report on quality of life or toxicity. Since no randomised or quasi-randomised controlled studies on retinoid supplementation were identified, no conclusion on the supplementation of vitamin A in people with CF can be drawn. Additionally, due to methodological limitations in the included study, also reflected in the low-quality evidence judged following the specific evidence grading system (GRADE), no clear conclusions on β-carotene supplementation can be drawn. Until further data are available, country- or region-specific guidelines regarding these practices should be followed.","No studies comparing vitamin A or other retinoid supplements to placebo (dummy drug containing no vitamin A) were included, but we did find one study comparing beta-carotene supplementation (a precursor of vitamin A) to placebo. A total of 24 people with cystic fibrosis (aged 6.7 to 27.7 years) were put into groups at random and treated either with β-carotene capsules (at a high dose for three months followed by a low dose for a further three months) or with placebo (for six months). No studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in this review. The single included study revealed that high-dose beta-carotene supplementation for three months led to fewer days on which people with CF required antibiotics compared to placebo, but this was not the case in the following three-month section of the study when low-dose beta-carotene supplementation was compared to placebo. Other clinical outcome measures (growth, nutritional status and lung function) showed no statistical significant differences between treatment and placebo groups. No side effects were observed. The other outcomes in this review, such as vitamin A deficiency symptoms, mortality, toxicity and quality of life, were not reported. We could only include one study in this review and that study had several limitations. This is reflected in the assessment of low-quality evidence, judged using the specific evidence grading system (GRADE). So, we feel that the strength of evidence is low. Not all outcome measures were reported after each supplementation dose and results should be viewed with some caution as some beta-carotene from the high-dose period was probably still present in the blood during the low-dose supplementation period. Since no studies on vitamin A supplementation were included in the review, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the routine use of vitamin A supplements. Due to limitations of the included study of beta-carotene supplementation, no definitive conclusions regarding its use can be drawn either. Until further evidence is available, local guidelines should be followed regarding supplementation."
CD012378,"We included 13 trials involving 1472 subfertile women with PCOS who were receiving myo-inositol as pre-treatment to IVF (11 trials), or during ovulation induction (two trials). These studies compared MI versus placebo, no treatment/standard, melatonin, metformin, clomiphene citrate, or DCI. The evidence was of 'low' to 'very low' quality. The main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods, inconsistency, and lack of reporting of clinically relevant outcomes such as live birth and adverse events. We are uncertain whether MI improves live birth rates when compared to standard treatment among women undergoing IVF (OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.75 to 7.83; P = 0.14; 2 RCTs; 84 women; I² = 0%). Very low-quality evidence suggests that for subfertile women with PCOS undergoing pre-treatment to IVF who have an expected live birth rate of 12%, the rate among women using MI would be between 9% and 51%. We are uncertain whether MI may be associated with a decrease in miscarriage rate when compared to standard treatment (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.86; P = 0.02; 4 RCTs; 535 women; I² = 66%; very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS with an expected miscarriage rate of 9% who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, the rate among women using MI would be between 2% and 8%; however this meta-analysis is based primarily on one study, which reported an unusually high miscarriage rate in the control group, and this has resulted in very high heterogeneity. When we removed this trial from the sensitivity analysis, we no longer saw the effect, and we noted no conclusive differences between MI and standard treatment. Low-quality evidence suggests that MI may be associated with little or no difference in multiple pregnancy rates when compared with standard treatment (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.71; P = 0.89; 2 RCTs; 425 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with an expected multiple pregnancy rate of 18%, the rate among women using inositol would be between 12% and 27%. We are uncertain whether MI may be associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate when compared to standard treatment (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.85; P = 0.22; 4 RCTs; 535 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 26%, the rate among women using MI would be between 24% and 40%. Ovulation rates were not reported for this comparison. Other comparisons included only one trial in each, so for the comparisons MI versus antioxidant, MI versus an insulin-sensitising agent, MI versus an ovulation induction agent, and MI versus another DCI, meta-analysis was not possible. No pooled evidence was available for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction, as only single trials performed comparison of the insulin-sensitising agent and the ovulation induction agent. In light of available evidence of very low quality, we are uncertain whether MI improves live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate in subfertile women with PCOS undergoing IVF pre-treatment taking MI compared to standard treatment. We are also uncertain whether MI decreases miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates for these same women taking MI compared to standard treatment. No pooled evidence is available for use of MI versus placebo, another antioxidant, insulin-sensitising agents, ovulation induction agents, or another type of inositol for women with PCOS undergoing pre-treatment to IVF. No pooled evidence is available for use of MI in women undergoing ovulation induction.","In total, we found 13 randomised controlled trials involving 1472 subfertile women with PCOS. All of these studies included women with PCOS who were having difficulty conceiving. All of the women included in these studies were receiving usual prenatal care. In addition to this, women were given myo-inositol (a form of inositol) and then were compared to women who were receiving no treatment or were receiving melatonin, metformin, clomiphene citrate, or D-chiro-inositoI (another form of inositol). In 11 studies, all women were also having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and in the remaining two studies, women were undergoing ovulation induction. Few studies on this comparison are available, and the quality of these studies is low to very low. Based on currently available evidence, we were unable to show that taking myo-inositol increases the chances of becoming pregnant or having a baby among women with PCOS. Our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby, for women undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with standard treatment (folic acid alone) was 12%, the chance among women using myo-inositol could be as low as 9%, or could be as high 51%. We are unclear on whether myo-inositol could lower miscarriage rates, as these results are based on only two studies, one of which reported unusually high rates of miscarriage among women who were not receiving myo-inositol; therefore, we are not confident that this is the true effect of this treatment. MI may produce little or no difference in multiple pregnancy rates. We were unable to assess the benefit or harm of taking myo-inositol for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction, as we had identified only two trials, and each performed a different comparison. We assessed the quality of the evidence as ranging from low to very low due to poor explanations of how these trials were run and the small number of trials that we could include. Also, reporting on issues that are important for subfertile couples was poor; these include the chance of having a baby when taking myo-inositol, and whether its use leads to harmful effects."
CD009730,"We included 40 studies involving 1717 participants. The quality of the included studies was largely poor and, with a few exceptions, these comprised of mainly small, inadequately reported studies. When comparing treatment with a single antibiotic to a combined antibiotic regimen, those participants receiving a combination of antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function when considered as a whole group across a number of different measurements of lung function, but with very low quality evidence. When limited to the four placebo-controlled studies (n = 214), no difference was observed, again with very low quality evidence. With regard to the review's remaining primary outcomes, there was no effect upon time to next exacerbation and no studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. There were no effects on the secondary outcomes weight or adverse effects. When comparing specific antibiotic combinations there were no significant differences between groups on any measure. In the comparisons between intravenous and nebulised antibiotic or oral antibiotic (low quality evidence), there were no significant differences between groups on any measure. No studies in any comparison reported on quality of life. The quality of evidence comparing intravenous antibiotics with placebo is poor. No specific antibiotic combination can be considered to be superior to any other, and neither is there evidence showing that the intravenous route is superior to the inhaled or oral routes. There remains a need to understand host-bacteria interactions and in particular to understand why many people fail to fully respond to treatment.","The review included 40 studies with 1717 people with cystic fibrosis. Studies compared intravenous antibiotics with placebo (dummy drug with no active medication) and also one antibiotic compared to two antibiotics given together. Specific antibiotic combinations were also compared as were intravenous antibiotics with antibiotics that were breathed in (inhaled) and antibiotics that were swallowed (oral). The studies lasted from three to 15 days, although most of the studies lasted for two weeks. In the comparison between those people who were given just one antibiotic and those who were given two, it appeared that those receiving two antibiotics experienced a greater improvement in lung function, but when limited to only those studies that included a dummy drug, we did not see any difference. There was no effect upon the amount of time until the next exacerbation, weight, or adverse effects. No combination of antibiotics was any better than any other. The outcomes for people were the same irrespective of whether they were treated by intravenous, oral or inhaled antibiotics. None of the studies reported on quality of life. The quality of the included studies was often poor and many were not properly reported. Some studies included volunteers more than once which made comparing treatments difficult. It was also often difficult to decide from the information given how well the studies were carried out - particularly with respect to how volunteers were chosen and whether the volunteers or doctors could tell which treatment they were being given."
CD008516,"We included seven trials with 1369 participants. All trials had high risk of bias. Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three other trials (including one that used both definitions) used the second definition. None of the included trials mentioned our primary outcomes. However, regarding the secondary outcomes, extension of the treatment period to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response according to both definitions (71/217 (32.7%) versus 52/194 (26.8%); risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.92, P = 0.02, I2 = 8%; and 265/499 (53.1%) versus 207/496 (41.7%); RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.50, P = 0.006, I2 = 38%), with a risk difference of 0.11 and calculated number needed to treat of nine. The end of treatment response was not significantly different between the two treatment groups. The number of participants who relapsed virologically was found to be lower in the groups that had been treated for 72 weeks using both definitions (27/84 (32.1%) versus 46/91 (50.5%); RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86, P = 0.007, I2 = 18%, 3 trials; and 85/350 (24.3%) versus 146/353 (41.4%); RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47, 0.73, P < 0.000001, I2 = 0%, 3 trials). The length of treatment did not significantly affect the adherence (247/279 (88.5%) versus 252/274 (92.0%); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07, P = 0.42, I2 = 69%, 3 trials). In the single trial that reported adverse events, no significant difference was seen between the two treatment groups. This review demonstrates higher a proportion of sustained virological response after extension of treatment from 48 weeks to 72 weeks in HCV genotype 1 infected patients in whom HCV RNA was still detectable but decreased by ≥ 2 log after 12 weeks and became negative after 24 weeks of treatment, and in patients with detectable HCV RNA after four weeks of treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin. The observed intervention effects can be caused by both systematic error (bias) and random errors (play of chance). There was no reporting on mortality and the reporting of clinical outcomes and adverse events was insufficient. More data are needed in order to recommend or reject the policy of extending the treatment period for slow responders.","We found seven randomised clinical trials that compared a treatment duration of 72 weeks with 48 weeks in 1369 participants. The quality of all trials was low. Mortality and liver-related morbidity were not reported in any of the included trials. Sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA after six months from the end of an entire course of treatment) was increased when the decision to prolong treatment was taken based on viral load after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.92) as well as when the decision to prolong treatment was taken based on the results of the viral load after four weeks of treatment (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.50). The calculated number needed to treat to achieve an increase in sustained virological response proportions was nine (meaning that among nine participants treated for 72 weeks instead of 48 weeks, only one more will achieve a sustained virological response compared to the participants treated for 48 weeks). The higher sustained virological response after 72 weeks of treatment was caused by a reduction in the number of patients in this group who experienced a virological relapse after treatment. Adherence to treatment was not different between the two groups. Serious adverse events were mentioned in only one trial, and they were not different in the two treatment groups. The findings may be influenced by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and the risk of random errors (play of chance). Further large-scale, randomised trials with reporting of patient relevant outcomes are warranted."
CD006866,"Six RCTs with a total of 1211 participants were eligible; five trials evaluated oral aciclovir, and one, with 419 participants, evaluated oral famciclovir. We were able to conduct meta-analyses as there were sufficient similarities in the included studies, such as the reporting of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation and treatment regimen. For our primary outcome, based on three trials (609 participants) we found no significant difference between the aciclovir and control groups in the incidence of PHN four months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.11), nor was there a significant difference at six months (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, two trials, 476 participants). In four of the trials (692 participants), there was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain four weeks after the onset of rash. In the trial of famciclovir versus placebo, neither 500 mg nor 750 mg doses of famciclovir reduced the incidence of herpetic neuralgia significantly. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache for aciclovir, and headache and nausea for famciclovir. For neither treatment was the incidence of adverse events significantly different from placebo. None of the studies were at high risk of bias, although the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain for all but one study. We found no new RCTs when we updated the searches in April 2013. There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments; therefore, further well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate famciclovir or other new antiviral agents in preventing PHN. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.","We identified six clinical trials that met our standards for inclusion in the review. They included a total of 1319 participants. We decided that our main measure of whether antiviral medicines work in preventing PHN would be whether or not PHN had developed six months after a first attack of shingles (some of the studies we included of aciclovir measured PHN at four months). Aciclovir, which is an antiviral medicine, was used in five trials (900 participants) and was not better than a placebo (dummy pill) in preventing PHN. In the other trial (419 participants), famciclovir, which is another antiviral drug, was no better than placebo in preventing pain following healing of the shingles rash. The number of side effects with aciclovir and famciclovir was not very different from the number with placebo. The trials did not have any major problems of design or conduct that put the results in doubt, although most of the reports did not provide enough information to fully assess every aspect. We conclude that according to high quality evidence, oral aciclovir was ineffective in reducing the incidence of PHN and there is not enough evidence on other antiviral treatments. There need to be further well-designed trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents with a greater number of participants. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should include different groups of people, such as those who have lowered immunity. The evidence is current to April 2013, when the searches were last updated. Because new evidence on this topic is slow to emerge, we have scheduled the next update of this review for 2017."
CD003289,"Forty-one trials involving more than 13,000 young people met our inclusion criteria (26 individually randomized controlled trials and 15 cluster-randomized trials). We judged the majority of studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Interventions were varied, with the majority adopting forms of individual or group counselling, with or without additional self-help materials to form complex interventions. Eight studies used primarily computer or messaging interventions, and four small studies used pharmacological interventions (nicotine patch or gum, or bupropion). There was evidence of an intervention effect for group counselling (9 studies, risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.77), but not for individual counselling (7 studies, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.39), mixed delivery methods (8 studies, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66) or the computer or messaging interventions (pooled RRs between 0.79 and 1.18, 9 studies in total). There was no clear evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions, although confidence intervals were wide (nicotine replacement therapy 3 studies, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.58; bupropion 1 study RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.02). No subgroup precluded the possibility of a clinically important effect. Studies of pharmacotherapies reported some adverse events considered related to study treatment, though most were mild, whereas no adverse events were reported in studies of behavioural interventions. Our certainty in the findings for all comparisons is low or very low, mainly because of the clinical heterogeneity of the interventions, imprecision in the effect size estimates, and issues with risk of bias. There is limited evidence that either behavioural support or smoking cessation medication increases the proportion of young people that stop smoking in the long-term. Findings are most promising for group-based behavioural interventions, but evidence remains limited for all intervention types. There continues to be a need for well-designed, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers.","We identified 41 studies (around 13,000 participants) that researched ways of helping teenagers to quit smoking. These studies were of mixed quality and looked at various methods for stopping smoking, including one-to-one counselling, counselling as part of a group, methods using computers or text messaging, or a combination of these. Four studies used drug treatments such as nicotine patches. Most studies recruited participants from schools, and 29 of the studies were carried out in North America. Although some programmes showed promise, especially those that used group counselling and those that combined a variety of approaches, there was no strong evidence that any particular method was effective in helping young people to stop smoking. Trials differed in how they measured whether a person had quit smoking, and many trials did not have enough participants for us to be confident about wider application of the results. Medications such as nicotine replacement and bupropion were not shown to be successful with adolescents, and some adverse events were reported, although these events were generally mild and findings were based on studies with small numbers of participants. Based on these findings we cannot currently identify a programme for helping adolescents to stop smoking that is more successful than trying to stop unaided. The quality of evidence was low or very low for all of the outcomes in this review. This is because of issues with the quality of some of the studies, the small number of studies and participants for some outcomes, and the differences between the studies."
CD003749,"Three studies with a combined total of 309 participants were included in the review. One study compared two-stage versus one-stage BKA; one study compared skew flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA; and one study compared sagittal flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA. Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate. BKA using skew flaps or sagittal flaps conferred no advantage over the well established long posterior flap technique (primary stump healing was 60% for both skew flaps and long posterior flap (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.42) and primary stump healing was 58% for sagittal flaps and 55% for long posterior flap (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.43). For participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by a definitive long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure (Peto OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.89). Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation, and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons. There is no evidence to show a benefit of one type of incision over another. However, in the presence of wet gangrene a two-stage procedure leads to better primary stump healing compared to a one-stage procedure. The choice of amputation technique can, therefore, be a matter of surgeon preference taking into account factors such as previous experience of a particular technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and the location of pre-existing surgical scars.","Three randomised controlled studies were identified. Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate. They were reported on between 1977 and 1991 and involved a total of 309 participants. Each reported on different comparisons. Below knee amputation using skew flaps or sagittal flaps provided no advantage over the long posterior flap technique on primary stump healing, which approached 60% for all groups. In the third study, involving 30 participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure with delayed skin closure. Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons. Nearly all the surgeons in the study that looked at skew flap amputation versus the long posterior flap technique were new to the skew flap operation and so were on a learning curve. Factors which might have influenced the findings include previous experience of a technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and location of pre-existing surgical scars."
CD007543,"This review identified 17 randomized studies that addressed whether enhanced glucose control prevents the development of neuropathy. Seven of these studies were conducted in people with type 1 diabetes, eight in type 2 diabetes, and two in both types. A meta-analysis of the two studies that reported the primary outcome (incidence of clinical neuropathy) with a total of 1228 participants with type 1 diabetes revealed a significantly reduced risk of developing clinical neuropathy in those with enhanced glucose control, an annualized RD of -1.84% (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to -2.56). In a similar analysis of four studies that reported the primary outcome, involving 6669 participants with type 2 diabetes, the annualized RD of developing clinical neuropathy was -0.58% (95% CI 0.01 to -1.17). Most secondary outcomes were significantly in favor of intensive treatment in both populations. However, both types of diabetic participants also had a significant increase in severe adverse events including hypoglycemic events. According to high-quality evidence, enhanced glucose control significantly prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve conduction and vibration threshold abnormalities in type 1 diabetes mellitus. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, enhanced glucose control reduces the incidence of clinical neuropathy, although this was not formally statistically significant (P = 0.06). However, enhanced glucose control does significantly reduce nerve conduction and vibration threshold abnormalities. Importantly, enhanced glucose control significantly increases the risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, which needs to be taken into account when evaluating its risk/benefit ratio.","This review identified 17 randomized studies that addressed whether more aggressive attempts to lower blood glucose levels prevent people from developing neuropathy. Seven of these studies were conducted in people with type 1 diabetes, eight in type 2 diabetes, and two in both types. However, only two studies in type 1 diabetes including 1228 participants and four studies in type 2 diabetes including 6669 participants investigated our primary outcome. In type 1 diabetes, there was a significant effect of more aggressive therapies in preventing neuropathy compared with standard treatment. In type 2 diabetes, more aggressive therapy was also beneficial in preventing symptoms and signs of clinical neuropathy, but the result was not statistically significant as measured by the primary method selected for this review. However, there was a significant positive effect on the amount of nerve damage measured with electrical nerve conduction tests and a special machine to measure the threshold of detection of vibration in both types of diabetes. Overall, the evidence indicates that more aggressive treatments of sugar levels delay the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. No other treatments have proven effective to date. However, the beneficial effect has to be balanced against the significantly increased risk of dangerously low blood sugar levels that can occur in both types of diabetes and which can lead to brain injury amongst other issues."
CD009176,"Nine trials were used in the analysis (n = 1282 patients). These trials were found to be predominantly at low risk of bias. We did not find strong evidence of an effect of DSI on the total duration of ventilation. Pooled data from nine trials demonstrated a 13% reduction in the geometric mean, with relatively wide confidence intervals (CI) indicating imprecision (95% CI 26% reduction to 2% increase, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, we did not find strong evidence of an effect on ICU length of stay (-10%, 95% CI -20% to 3%, n = 9 trials, moderate quality evidence) or hospital length of stay (-6%, 95% CI -18% to 8%, n = 8 trials, moderate quality evidence). Heterogeneity for these three outcomes was moderate and statistically significant. The risk ratio for ICU mortality was 0.96 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.21, n = 7 trials, moderate quality evidence), for rate of accidental endotracheal tube removal 1.07 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.12, n = 6 trials, moderate quality evidence), for catheter removal 1.48 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.90, n = 4 trials), and for incidence of new onset delirium 1.02 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.13, n = 3 trials, moderate quality evidence). Differences in the doses of any drug used or quality of life score (Short Form (SF)-36) did not reach statistical significance. Tracheostomy was performed less frequently in the DSI group (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92, n = 6 trials, moderate quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis of unlogged data resulted in similar findings. Post hoc analysis to further explain heterogeneity, based on study country of origin, showed that studies conducted in North America resulted in a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation (-21%, 95% CI -33% to -5%, n = 5 trials). We have not found strong evidence that DSI alters the duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, length of ICU or hospital stay, adverse event rates, drug consumption, or quality of life for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation compared to sedation strategies that do not include DSI. We advise that caution should be applied when interpreting and applying the findings as the overall effect of treatment is always < 1 and the upper limit of the CI is only marginally higher than the no-effect line. These results should be considered unstable rather than negative for DSI given the statistical and clinical heterogeneity identified in the included trials.","we included nine studies involving 1282 critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Studies compared daily sedation interruption to strategies that did not include an interruption. Studies were conducted worldwide and involved both medical and surgical critically ill patients. we did not find strong evidence that daily sedation interruption reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital, death, or the amount of drug used. The effect on adverse events such as accidental removal of the breathing tube or invasive devices, or the rate of delirium was uncertain. However, tracheostomy was performed less often in those who were managed with daily sedation interruption. Sedation practices are known to vary worldwide, and as such an analysis of studies conducted in North America showed a reduction in time on the breathing machine for those who were managed with daily sedation interruption compared to those who were not. we advise caution should be applied when interpreting and applying our study findings. The results are based upon a small number of studies that were heterogeneous or not uniform in terms of methods, patients studied, and clinical management and our overall results only marginally crossed the no-effect line."
CD013648,"We identified 97 eligible studies and sampled 37 of them for our analysis. Most sampled studies were from high-income countries, with four from middle-income and two from low-income countries. In 27 sampled studies, the participants were survivors, in three they were intervention facilitators. Two included all three of our stakeholder groups, and five included two of our groups. The studies explored a wide range of psychosocial interventions, with only one type of intervention explored in more than one study. The review indicates that features associated with the context in which interventions were delivered had an impact on how individuals accessed and experienced interventions. This included organisational features, such as staff turnover, that could influence survivors' engagement with interventions; the setting or location in which interventions were delivered; and the characteristics associated with who delivered the interventions. Studies that assess the effectiveness of interventions typically assess their impact on mental health; however, as well as finding benefits to mental health, our QES found that study participants felt interventions also had positive impacts on their physical health, mood, understanding of trauma, interpersonal relationships and enabled them to re-engage with a wide range of areas in their lives. Participants explained that features of interventions and their contexts that best enabled them to benefit from interventions were also often things that could be a barrier to benefiting from interventions. For example, the relationship with the therapist, when open and warm was a benefit, but if such a relationship could not be achieved, it was a barrier. Survivors' levels of readiness and preparedness to both start and end interventions could have positive (if they were ready) or negative (if they were not) impacts. Study participants identified the potential risks and harms associated with completing interventions but felt that it was important to face and process trauma. Some elements of interventions were specific to the intervention type (e.g. faith-based interventions), or related to an experience of an intervention that held particular relevance to subgroups of survivors (e.g. minority groups); these issues could impact how individuals experienced delivering or receiving interventions. We had high or moderate confidence in all but one of our review findings. Further research in low- and middle-income settings, with male survivors of sexual abuse and violence and those from minority groups could strengthen the evidence for low and moderate confidence findings. We found that few interventions had published quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Since this QES has highlighted important aspects that could enable interventions to be more suitable for survivors, using a range of methodologies would provide valuable information that could enhance intervention uptake, completion and effectiveness. This study has shown that although survivors often found interventions difficult, they also appreciated that they needed to work through trauma, which they said resulted in a wide range of benefits. Therefore, listening to survivors and providing appropriate interventions, at the right time for them, can make a significant difference to their health and well-being.","We analysed 37 of the 97 studies that were relevant to our review. Most of the 37 studies were from high-income countries and included survivors. There was a wide range of interventions that supported and responded to those who had experienced sexual abuse and violence included in these studies, with only one type of intervention examined in more than one study. Our review highlighted that people did not discuss the features of the different types of interventions (e.g. aspects related to mindfulness therapy, or rape counselling) but rather, referred to a wide range of features associated with the interventions they considered important. For example,
- they emphasised that a good relationship with the therapist was vital,
- that other members of the group (where interventions were delivered in groups) could make them feel more or less included. They also stressed that features of the wider setting of the intervention, such as the location and friendliness of a receptionist and other staff, had an important impact on them being able to benefit from interventions. The review showed that survivors benefitted from the interventions in a wide range of ways, most of which have not been examined in more quantitative research studies that look at how effective these interventions are. Such studies tend to examine mental health, but our review found that survivors thought interventions had also benefitted their:
- physical health,
- mood,
- relationships with others,
- confidence
- and ability to set boundaries and be assertive. This review includes studies published up to May 2021."
CD002994,"Nine RCTs of mixed duration (3 days-52 weeks), recruiting 1175 participants were included (NYHA functional classes II-IV). Intravenous prostacyclin versus usual care (four studies) : There were significant improvements in exercise capacity of around 90 metres, cardiopulmonary haemodynamics and NYHA functional class over 3 days-12 weeks. Effects were consistent in primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension. Oral prostacyclin versus placebo (two studies) : Short-term data (3-6 months) indicated that there was a significant improvement in exercise capacity, but data from one study of 52 weeks reported no significant difference at 12 months. No significant differences were observed for any other outcome. Subcutaneous treprostinil versus placebo (two studies, 8-12 weeks):  One large study reported a significant median improvement in exercise capacity of around 16 metres. Cardiopulmonary haemodynamics and symptom scores favoured treprostinil. Infusion site pain and withdrawals due to adverse events were more frequent with treprostinil. Inhaled prostacyclin versus placebo (one study, 12 weeks):  There was a significant increase in exercise capacity of approximately 36 metres. Treatment led to better symptom scores and functional class status than with placebo. Subgroup analyses reported by individual studies showed a better exercise capacity in participants with PPH, than those participants with PH secondary to other diseases. Side effects and adverse events were common in the studies. There is evidence that intravenous prostacyclin in addition to conventional therapy at tolerable doses optimised by titration, can confer some short-term benefits (up to 12 weeks of treatment) in exercise capacity, NYHA functional class and cardiopulmonary haemodynamics. There is also some evidence that patients with more severe disease based upon NYHA functional class showed a greater response to treatment.","Prostacyclin may benefit patients with pulmonary hypertension (raised blood pressure in the lungs) in the short term but studies longer in duration are required. Pulmonary hypertension occurs when blood is pumped through arteries in the lungs at an increased pressure. The condition can lead to heart failure and death. Once the diagnosis is made, life expectancy ranges from a few months to a few years. Most current treatments apart from lung transplantation do not improve survival. Over an 8-12 week period prostacyclin improved exercise capacity and some measures of blood flow when given intravenously or via injection to patients with pulmonary hypertension. However, with intravenous administration there can be serious side effects as the drug has to be given continuously via a pump into a catheter placed into a central vein. It is not clear how long the drug continues to confer benefit without serious side effects. Prostacyclin can also be given by mouth, under the skin or through an inhaler. These forms of administration may be safer than intravenous prostacyclin and there is evidence that these may be effective in the short term."
CD010826,"We included one trial that randomised 752 primiparous women with clinically detectable second-degree perineal tears to either further assessment with EAUS prior to perineal repair or standard care. We assessed this trial as being at a low risk of bias. The trial reported women's anal incontinence at three and 12 months as well as their pain scores and quality of life assessment. The trial authors reported outcomes at three months for 719 women (364 in the experimental group, 355 in the control group, 4% loss to follow-up), and an outcome at 12 months for 684 women (342 in the experimental group, 342 in the control group, 9% loss to follow-up). Primary outcome
Compared with clinical examination (routine care), the use of EAUS prior to perineal repair was associated with a reduction in the rate of severe anal incontinence (defined as involuntary loss of faeces or flatus that constitutes social and/or hygiene problems, or as defined by authors), at greater than six months postpartum (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.97, 684 women at the 12-month time point). Secondary outcomes
Severe anal incontinence at less than six months was reduced with the use of EAUS prior to repair when compared with clinical examination (routine care) (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.72, 719 women). However, increased perineal pain at three months was associated with the use of EAUS prior to perineal repair when compared with routine care (RR 5.86, 95% CI 1.74 to 19.72, 684 women). There was no clear difference in the number of women who reported any anal incontinence at either less than six months or equal to or greater than six months (outcomes not prespecified in our published protocol). Similarly, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of faecal incontinence, flatal incontinence, faecal urgency, or maternal quality of life. The study did not report any data on the need for secondary repair of external anal sphincter, dyspareunia, women's satisfaction with care or the planned or actual mode of birth in any subsequent pregnancy. We were unable to assess the detection rates of OASIS with EAUS from the included study because women with clinically-detected OASIS were excluded from randomisation. There is some evidence to suggest that EAUS prior to perineal repair is associated with reduced risk of severe anal incontinence but an increase in the incidence of perineal pain at three months postpartum. However, these results are based on one small study involving 752 women. The study took place in a large teaching hospital with an average to busy labour ward. The trial participants were similar to those found in most large obstetric units in developed countries, thus increasing applicability of the evidence, but were restricted to primiparous women. More research is needed to further evaluate the effectiveness of EAUS in the detection of OASIS following vaginal birth and in reducing the risk of anal sphincter complications related to OASIS. More high-quality RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the intervention before the routine use of EAUS on the labour ward could be supported. It would be particularly useful if future trials could assess detection rates of OASIS with EAUS versus clinical examination alone as this is the basis of the theory for improved outcomes with this intervention. Cost and the training required to implement EAUS should be considered, along with maternal quality of life and individual symptoms experienced by postnatal women . It would also be useful to follow up women after their subsequent vaginal births to determine if subsequent mode of delivery affects long-term outcomes. Future studies in multiparous women may also be useful.","We found one randomised controlled trial that met our inclusion criteria. This trial included 752 women who, following vaginal birth, had a tear to the skin between the vagina and anus that did not include the anal muscles on clinical examination. The women were allocated to receive either routine care (clinical examination) or anal ultrasound prior to their tear being sutured (stitched). We found that women who had anal ultrasound before undergoing perineal repair were about half as likely to suffer from severe anal symptoms. This difference was clear at less than six months and greater than or equal to six months after giving birth. Women were, however, more likely to have significant perineal pain at three months after birth if they underwent ultrasound examination. Solid stool incontinence and involuntary loss of gas (flatulence) were not clearly different between the two groups of women. There was also no difference in terms of maternal quality of life. The study did not report on the need for secondary repair of external anal sphincter, the number of women who reported pain during sexual intercourse, women's satisfaction with care or details relating to mode of birth in any subsequent pregnancy. It was not possible to look at how effective anal ultrasound examination was at detecting anal sphincter injuries because women with clinically-detected obstetric-related anal sphincter injury were excluded from the study. We assessed the included trial as being at low risk of bias as it was a well designed trial, but it involved a small number of women. More trials are needed in this area to further evaluate this intervention and inform future practice. We did not find any studies that used ultrasound after the tear had been sutured. It would be helpful if future studies could evaluate how effective ultrasound is at detecting obstetric anal sphincter injury. The cost of the intervention and any training needs should be considered, along with maternal quality of life and individual symptoms experienced by postnatal women. It would also be useful to examine how women give birth with subsequent pregnancies and longer-term outcomes."
CD006055,"Twenty-four trials involving 4422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analysed results by intention to treat; we re-analysed the remainder. Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.02); metallic taste, and nausea and vomiting were more common in the metronidazole group (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.59; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.51, respectively). Given intravaginally as gelatin tablets, lactobacillus was more effective than oral metronidazole  (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.08). Similarly, oral lactobacillus combined with metronidazole was more effective than metronidazole alone (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.77). Clindamycin showed a lower rate of clinical failure than triple sulfonamide cream (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72). Hydrogen peroxide douche showed a higher rate of clinical failure (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.00) and adverse events (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.52) than a single 2 g dose of metronidazole. Clindamycin preparations, oral metronidazole, and oral and intravaginal tablets of lactobacillus were effective for bacterial vaginosis. Hydrogen peroxide douche and triple sulphonamide cream were ineffective. Metronidazole caused metallic taste, nausea and vomiting. We need better-designed trials with larger sample sizes to test the effectiveness of promising drugs.","This review evaluated the effectiveness and adverse effects of antimicrobial agents used to treat BV in non-pregnant women. Twenty-four trials involving 4422 women were reviewed. With regard to less treatment failure, clindamycin was superior to placebo but comparable to metronidazole, irrespective of the dose regimen. Metronidazole tended to cause a higher rate of adverse events, such as metallic taste and nausea and vomiting, than did clindamycin. Oral lactobacillus combined with metronidazole was more effective than metronidazole alone. Administered in an intravaginal gelatin tablet, lactobacillus was also more effective than oral metronidazole. Triple sulfonamide cream was less effective compared with clindamycin. Hydrogen peroxide douche was not as effective as a single 2 g dose of metronidazole yet caused more harms. Only one trial involved asymptomatic women and the result was not conclusive. There was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion on the effectiveness of other promising drugs. Drugs effective for bacterial vaginosis include clindamycin preparations, oral metronidazole, and oral and intravaginal tablets of lactobacillus. Adverse effects of metronidazole include metallic taste, and nausea and vomiting. Information on possible side effects of lactobacillus preparations is required."
CD011384,"We included 84 RCTs with 8234 participants in this review. Six trials (N = 658) did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The remaining 78 trials excluded 210 participants after randomisation. Thus, a total of 7366 participants in 78 trials contributed to one or more outcomes for this review. The treatments assessed in these 78 trials included antibiotics, antioxidants, aprotinin, atropine, calcitonin, cimetidine, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), gabexate, glucagon, iniprol, lexipafant, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), octreotide, oxyphenonium, probiotics, activated protein C, somatostatin, somatostatin plus omeprazole, somatostatin plus ulinastatin, thymosin, ulinastatin, and inactive control. Apart from the comparison of antibiotics versus control, which included a large proportion of participants with necrotising pancreatitis, the remaining comparisons had only a small proportion of patients with this condition. Most trials included either only participants with severe acute pancreatitis or included a mixture of participants with mild acute pancreatitis and severe acute pancreatitis (75 trials). Overall, the risk of bias in trials was unclear or high for all but one of the trials. Source of funding: seven trials were not funded or funded by agencies without vested interest in results. Pharmaceutical companies partially or fully funded 21 trials. The source of funding was not available from the remaining trials. Since we considered short-term mortality as the most important outcome, we presented only these results in detail in the abstract. Sixty-seven studies including 6638 participants reported short-term mortality. There was no evidence of any differences in short-term mortality in any of the comparisons (very low-quality evidence). With regards to other primary outcomes, serious adverse events (number) were lower than control in participants taking lexipafant (rate ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96; N = 290; 1 study; very low-quality evidence), octreotide (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.89; N = 770; 5 studies; very low-quality evidence), somatostatin plus omeprazole (rate ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.70; N = 140; 1 study; low-quality evidence), and somatostatin plus ulinastatin (rate ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.60; N = 122; 1 study; low-quality evidence). The proportion of people with organ failure was lower in octreotide than control (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; N = 430; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence). The proportion of people with sepsis was lower in lexipafant than control (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83; N = 290; 1 study; very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of differences in any of the remaining comparisons in these outcomes or for any of the remaining primary outcomes (the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event and the occurrence of infected pancreatic necrosis). None of the trials reported heath-related quality of life. Very low-quality evidence suggests that none of the pharmacological treatments studied decrease short-term mortality in people with acute pancreatitis. However, the confidence intervals were wide and consistent with an increase or decrease in short-term mortality due to the interventions. We did not find consistent clinical benefits with any intervention. Because of the limitations in the prognostic scoring systems and because damage to organs may occur in acute pancreatitis before they are clinically manifest, future trials should consider including pancreatitis of all severity but power the study to measure the differences in the subgroup of people with severe acute pancreatitis. It may be difficult to power the studies based on mortality. Future trials in participants with acute pancreatitis should consider other outcomes such as complications or health-related quality of life as primary outcomes. Such trials should include health-related quality of life, costs, and return to work as outcomes and should follow patients for at least three months (preferably for at least one year).","We included 84 RCTs with 8234 participants in this review. Six trials (658 participants) did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. In the remaining 78 trials, 210 participants were excluded after randomisation. Thus, a total of 7366 participants in 78 trials contributed to one or more outcomes for this review. Apart from the comparison of whether antibiotics should be used, the other comparisons included only a small percentage of people with pancreatic necrosis (an extremely severe form of pancreatitis, which results in pancreatic destruction). Most trials included only the severe form of acute pancreatitis or included both mild and severe forms of pancreatitis. Source of funding: seven trials were not funded or were funded by agencies without vested interest in results. Twenty-one trials were partly or fully funded by pharmaceutical companies. The source of funding was not available from the remaining trials. The overall quality of evidence was low for all the measures because the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias (a systematic error or deviation from the truth that affects the results, favouring one treatment over another) and were small trials. As a result, further studies are required on this topic. Sixty-seven studies including 6638 participants reported short-term deaths. Overall, an average 12% of people who received only supportive care died. There was no evidence that any of the treatments decreased short-term deaths. There was evidence that various treatments might be beneficial in a number of outcomes; however, these results were not consistent, and we cannot make any conclusions as to whether any of the treatments may be beneficial. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. In conclusion, based on low quality evidence, there is no evidence that any drug treatment added on to supportive care decreases short-term deaths. Future trials in participants with acute pancreatitis should include health-related quality of life, costs, and return to work as outcomes and should follow patients for at least three months (preferably for at least one year)."
CD008240,"We included 7 RCTs, with a total of 249 participants, covering 6 treatments. Six of these RCTs tested the efficacy of one active intervention against placebo or another active intervention, while the other trial tested three active interventions against placebo. When compared to placebo in one trial, clobetasol propionate 0.05% was effective in treating genital lichen sclerosus in relation to the following outcomes: 'participant-rated improvement or remission of symptoms' (risk ratio (RR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 5.61) and 'investigator-rated global degree of improvement' (standardised mean difference (SMD) 5.74, 95% CI 4.26 to 7.23). When mometasone furoate 0.05% was compared to placebo in another trial, there was a significant improvement in the 'investigator-rated change in clinical grade of phimosis' (SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.77 to -0.31). Both trials found no significant differences in reported adverse drug reactions between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. The data from four trials found no significant benefit for topical testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and progesterone. When used as maintenance therapy after an initial treatment with topical clobetasol propionate in another trial, topical testosterone worsened the symptoms (P < 0.05), but the placebo did not. One trial found no differences between pimecrolimus and clobetasol propionate in relieving symptoms through change in pruritus (itching) (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.33) and burning/pain (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.62 to 0.69). However, pimecrolimus was less effective than clobetasol propionate with regard to the 'investigator-rated global degree of improvement' (SMD -1.64, 95% CI -2.40 to -0.87). This trial found no significant differences in reported adverse drug reactions between the pimecrolimus and placebo groups. The current limited evidence demonstrates the efficacy of clobetasol propionate, mometasone furoate, and pimecrolimus in treating genital lichen sclerosus. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal potency and regimen of topical corticosteroids, examine other topical interventions, assess the duration of remission or prevention of flares, evaluate the reduction in the risk of genital squamous cell carcinoma or genital intraepithelial neoplasia, and examine the efficacy in improving the quality of the sex lives of people with this condition.","We included 7 trials, with a total of 249 participants, covering 6 treatments in this review. Topical clobetasol propionate and mometasone furoate were effective in treating genital lichen sclerosus. There was no substantial difference in the efficacy of relieving symptoms (e.g. itching and pain) between pimecrolimus cream and clobetasol propionate, but the former was less effective in improving gross appearance. More research is needed for a number of reasons: to decide the strength of steroids that should be used, as well as the frequency and length of application to the skin which gives the best results; to examine other skin treatments; to assess the long-term benefits of topical treatments with regard to relieving symptoms and reducing the risk of developing genital cancers; and to examine the benefits of treatments on the quality of the sex lives of people with this condition."
CD009566,"We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment. It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term. However, there is no long-term data on their efficacy. Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence.","The evidence is current to July 2014. Among the 30 studies reviewed there were 17 different comparisons, including 4344 participants ranging in age between 4 and 85 years. The duration of treatment ranged from one to eight weeks. Ten out of 30 studies were funded by the drug manufacturer (8 totally and 2 partially funded); 20 studies did not report any source of funding. There was inconsistency in the way the effect of treatment was measured and reported. Overall risk of bias was low. Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, are safe and effective for reducing symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. We found insufficient evidence to discern which topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers are the most effective."
CD012019,"We included eight studies involving 646 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The urinary biomarkers were evaluated either in a specific phase of menstrual cycle or irrespective of the cycle phase. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of four urinary biomarkers for endometriosis, including three biomarkers distinguishing women with and without endometriosis (enolase 1 (NNE); vitamin D binding protein (VDBP); and urinary peptide profiling); and one biomarker (cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)) showing no significant difference between the two groups. All of these biomarkers were assessed in small individual studies and could not be statistically evaluated in a meaningful way. None of the biomarkers met the criteria for a replacement test or a triage test. Three studies evaluated three biomarkers that did not differentiate women with endometriosis from disease-free controls. There was insufficient evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use as a replacement or triage test in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Several urinary biomarkers may have diagnostic potential, but require further evaluation before being introduced into routine clinical practice. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and diagnosis of endometriosis using urinary biomarkers should only be undertaken in a research setting.","The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive-aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis."
CD013603,"The review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross-sectional qualitative design (mainly interviews and focus group discussions), and few used longitudinal or ethnographic (or both) designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There were gaps in the geographical spread for both HICs and LMICs and some countries were more dominant, such as the USA for HICs, South Africa for middle-income countries, and Uganda for low-income countries. Methods were mainly cross-sectional observational studies with few longitudinal studies. A minority of studies used an analytical conceptual model to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the integration study. The main finding was the various levels of diversity found in the evidence base on PHC integration studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences. The review identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated and these were categorised as: mental and behavioural health; HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and sexual reproductive health; maternal, women, and child health; non-communicable diseases; and two broader categories, namely general PHC services, and allied and specialised services. Within the health streams, the review mapped the scope of the interventions as full or partial integration. The review mapped the use of three different integration strategies and categorised these as horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage strategies. The wide range of healthcare workers who participated in the implementation of integration interventions was mapped and these included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay healthcare workers, and health system support staff. We mapped the range of client target populations. This scoping review provides a systematic, descriptive overview of the heterogeneity in qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experience of PHC integration, pointing to diversity with regard to country settings; study types; client populations; healthcare worker populations; and intervention focus, scope, and strategies. It would be important for researchers and decision-makers to understand how the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence how healthcare workers shape PHC integration impact. The classification of studies on the various dimensions (e.g. integration focus, scope, strategy, and type of healthcare workers and client populations) can help researchers to navigate the way the literature varies and for specifying potential questions for future qualitative evidence syntheses.","We searched for all published qualitative studies that reported on healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration up to 28 July 2020. We described the different study methods, countries, the scope and type of primary healthcare integration approaches, and the different types of healthcare workers and client groups involved. We then grouped the studies into categories. We included 184 studies. The studies were from 37 countries. About half the studies took place in high-income countries and half in low- and middle-income countries. The studies we found in our review covered a variety of settings, participants, and types of primary healthcare integration. There were different configurations for which healthcare service programmes were being combined for integrated service delivery. These were categorised into the following six configurations: mental health; HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health; maternal, woman, and child health; non-communicable diseases (for example, heart disease, diabetes); general primary health integration, and allied and specialised services. We also explored whether integrated service delivery was fully or partially integrated, and the different integration strategies used to link and co-ordinate services. The people participating in the implementation of integration interventions included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay health workers, and health system support staff. A wide range of clients were recipients of the integrated services. This scoping review shows the variety of primary healthcare integration approaches that have been studied. Researchers and decision-makers need to understand the relationship between different integration approaches and contexts, and the ways in which healthcare workers influence the impacts of this integration. The study categories we have developed can help researchers to understand these different types of integration approaches and to identify more focused questions for future systematic reviews."
CD007399,"Ten studies (813 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two studies only included participants 18 years and younger; six studies only included participants 18 years and older; one study included participants between 16 and 65 years of age and one study included only adults but did not specify the age range. Eight of the included studies had a high risk of bias. The included studies were clinically heterogeneous. We undertook no meta-analysis. The primary outcome measures of this review were: adverse effects (as defined by the study authors) and participant satisfaction (as defined by the study authors). In one study comparing propofol/fentanyl with ketamine/midazolam, delayed adverse reactions (nightmares and behavioural change) were noted in 10% of the ketamine/midazolam group and none in the propofol/fentanyl group. Seven individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in adverse effects between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions. Three individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in pain at the injection site between intravenous propofol and alternative interventions. Four individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in participant satisfaction between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions (ketamine, etomidate, midazolam). All the studies employed propofol without the use of an adjunctive analgesic and all, except one, were small (fewer than 100 participants) studies. The quality of evidence for the adverse effects and participant satisfaction outcomes was very low. Nine included studies (eight comparisons) reported all the secondary outcome measures of the review except mortality. It was not possible to pool the results of the included studies for any of the secondary outcome measures because the comparator interventions were different and the measures were reported in different ways. Seven individual studies reported no evidence of difference in incidence of hypoxia between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions. No firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the comparative effects of administering intravenous propofol, with or without an adjunctive analgesic agent, with alternative interventions in participants undergoing PS in the ED setting on adverse effects (including pain at the injection site) and participant satisfaction. The review was limited because no two included studies employed the same comparator interventions, and because the number of participants in eight of the included studies were small (fewer than 100 participants).","The evidence obtained is current to September 2013. We re-ran the search in February 2015 and we will deal with the study awaiting classification when we update the review. We included 10 studies involving 813 participants. The included studies compared propofol with five other alternative drugs used to sedate people in the ED. We could not pool the results of the 10 studies because no two studies compared the same drug options. We found very low quality evidence for the effects of propofol and the other drugs used for sedating people in the ED in terms of complications (side effects, including pain at the injection site) and participant satisfaction. In one study comparing a drug combination of propofol and fentanyl (a painkiller) with midazolam and ketamine (a drug which acts as both a painkiller and a sedative), delayed adverse reactions (nightmares and behavioural change) were noted in 10% of the ketamine/midazolam group and none in the propofol/fentanyl group. The quality of the evidence was overall very low."
CD010261,"We included three randomised trials that evaluated intramedullary nailing versus plating in 213 participants, with useable data from 173 participants of whom 112 were male. The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 41 to 44 years. There were no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment. The three included trials were at high risk of performance bias, with one trial also being at high risk of selection, detection and attrition bias. Overall, the quality of available evidence was rated as very low for all outcomes, meaning that we are very unsure about the estimates for all outcomes. Although the pooled results of three different measures of foot and ankle function indicated a small difference in favour of nailing (standard mean difference 0.28, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.59; 172 participants, 3 trials), the results of individual trials indicated that this was very unlikely to be a clinically important difference. Pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the need for reoperation or substantive physiotherapy for adverse events favoured nailing (4/90 versus 10/83; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.12), but included the possibility of a better outcome after plating. Based on an illustrative risk of 100 re-operations for adverse outcomes within one year of plate fixation in 1000 people with these fractures, 63 fewer (95% CI 88 fewer to 12 more) people per 1000 would have re-operations after nailing. Similarly pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the symptomatic nonunion or malunion, wound complications and fracture union favoured nailing but the 95% confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect and thus included the possibility of a better outcome after plating. Evidence from one trial (85 participants) showed no clinically important difference in pain between the two groups. Overall, there is either no or insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the use of surgery or the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. The available evidence, which is of very low quality, found no clinically important differences in function or pain, and did not confirm a difference in the need for re-operation or risk of complications between nailing and plating. The addition of evidence from two ongoing trials of nailing versus plating should inform this question in future updates. Further randomised trials are warranted on other issues, but should be preceded by research to identify priority questions.","We searched medical databases and trials registries in December 2014. We wanted to include studies in which receiving one surgical treatment or another surgical treatment was decided by chance. This research method, termed a randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to ensure that any measured improvement is caused by the treatment itself and no other factors. We found three RCTs involving 213 adults (with results available from 173) that compared nailing versus plating for treating distal tibial fractures. Overall the studies included around twice as many males as females and the average age of the study participants was just over 40 years. We found no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment. We found no clear differences between the nailing and plating groups in terms of patient-reported functional outcomes, re-operations for adverse outcomes, troublesome non-healing of the bone or deformity, pain, wound problems such as infection, or the numbers of individuals with healed fractures. Only three trials were identified and the sample sizes were small, so the results are imprecise. Moreover, the results of one trial were very likely to be biased due to flawed methodology. We therefore judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low, which means that we are very unsure of these results. Overall, the evidence is of very low quality and is insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the best method of surgery, including nailing versus plating, for treating breaks of the lower end of the shin bone in adults. Future updates of this review are likely to include evidence from currently ongoing research comparing nailing versus plating. Although other RCTs are needed to address key clinical questions on surgical methods for treating these fractures, these studies should be preceded by research to determine which questions should be prioritised."
CD004595,"No study examined the effect of screening (clinical and/or ultrasound) and early treatment versus not screening and later treatment. One study reported universal ultrasound compared to clinical examination alone did not result in a significant reduction in late diagnosed DDH or surgery but was associated with a significant increase in treatment. One study reported targeted ultrasound compared to clinical examination alone did not result in a significant reduction in late diagnosed DDH or surgery, with no significant difference in rate of treatment. Meta-analysis of two studies found universal ultrasound compared to targeted ultrasound did not result in a significant reduction in late diagnosed DDH or surgery. There was heterogeneity between studies reporting the effect on treatment rate. Meta-analysis of two studies found delayed ultrasound and targeted splinting compared to immediate splinting of infants with unstable (but not dislocated) hips resulted in no significant difference in the rate of late diagnosed DDH. Both studies reported a significant reduction in treatment with use of delayed ultrasound and targeted splinting. One study reported delayed ultrasound and targeted splinting compared to immediate splinting of infants with mild hip dysplasia on ultrasound resulted in no significant difference in late diagnosed DDH but a significant reduction in treatment. No infants in either group received surgery. There is insufficient evidence to give clear recommendations for practice. There is inconsistent evidence that universal ultrasound results in a significant increase in treatment compared to the use of targeted ultrasound or clinical examination alone. Neither of the ultrasound strategies have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes including late diagnosed DDH and surgery. The studies are substantially underpowered to detect significant differences in the uncommon event of late detected DDH or surgery. For infants with unstable hips or mildly dysplastic hips, use of delayed ultrasound and targeted splinting reduces treatment without significantly increasing the rate of late diagnosed DDH or surgery.","This review found no studies that compared the benefits and costs of early screening versus not screening for hip problems. Studies that compared the addition of ultrasound to clinical examination reported that when ultrasound was performed on all infants, the rate of treatment increased with no significant difference in rate of late detected dysplasia or surgery. Targeted ultrasound to infants at high risk of hip dysplasia did not significantly increase the rate of treatment but also did not significantly reduce the rate of late detected dysplasia or surgery. It is not possible to give clear recommendations for hip screening of newborn infants from the available evidence. Where infants are clinically detected as having unstable but not dislocated hips, or are detected on ultrasound to have mild hip dysplasia, there is evidence that delaying treatment by two to eight weeks reduces the need for treatment without a significant increase in late diagnosed dysplasia or surgery."
CD005490,"Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post-administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self-poisoning was also identified. There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent.

CD010823,"We included twenty studies with a total number of 2337 participants in this review. Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation with routine care or conventional delivery of information. One study compared brief psychoeducation with cognitive behavior therapy. Participants receiving brief psychoeducation were less likely to be non-compliant with medication than those receiving routine care in the short term (n = 448, 3 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.41 to 0.96, moderate quality evidence) and medium term (n = 118, 1 RCT, RR 0.17 CI 0.05 to 0.54, low quality evidence). Compliance with follow-up was similar between the two groups in the short term (n = 30, 1 RCT, RR 1.00, CI 0.24 to 4.18), medium term (n = 322, 4 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.50 to 1.09) and long term (n = 386, 2 RCTs, RR 1.19, CI 0.83 to 1.72). Relapse rates were significantly lower amongst participants receiving brief psychoeducation than those receiving routine care in the medium term (n = 406, RR 0.70 CI 0.52 to 0.93, moderate quality evidence), but not in the long term. Data from a few individual studies supported that brief psychoeducation: i) can improve the long-term global state (n = 59, 1 RCT, MD -6.70 CI -13.38 to -0.02, very low quality evidence); ii) promote improved mental state in short term (n = 60, 1 RCT, MD -2.70 CI -4.84 to -0.56,low quality evidence) and medium term; iii) can lower the incidence and severity of anxiety and depression. Social function such as rehabilitation status (n = 118, 1 RCT, MD -13.68 CI -14.85 to -12.51, low quality evidence) and social disability (n = 118, 1 RCT, MD -1.96 CI -2.09 to -1.83, low quality evidence) were also improved in the brief psychoeducation group. There was no difference found in quality of life as measured by GQOLI-74 in the short term (n = 62, 1 RCT, MD 0.63 CI -0.79 to 2.05, low quality evidence), nor the death rate in either groups (n = 154, 2 RCTs, RR 0.99, CI 0.15 to 6.65, low quality evidence). Based on mainly low to very low quality evidence from a limited number of studies, brief psychoeducation of any form appears to reduce relapse in the medium term, and promote medication compliance in the short term. A brief psychoeducational approach could potentially be effective, but further large, high-quality studies are needed to either confirm or refute the use of this approach.",". The review authors searched for randomised trials in 2013 and found 20 relevant studies with 2337 participants. Half of the studies were carried out in China. These trials randomised people to receive either brief psychoeducation sessions (these ranged from one-day psychoeducation to eight sessions of psychoeducation over a period of one year) or routine care. Based on information from a limited number of studies, brief psychoeducation does seem to reduce relapse and encourage people to take their medication. Those receiving brief psychoeducation also have more favourable results for mental state and social functioning. Although initial results are encouraging, most information and data for the main outcomes of interest, were rated as low or very low quality, and the number of trials providing useful data is small. Until further large, high-quality studies become available, the usefulness of brief psychoeducation remains debatable. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation.http://mcpin.org/"
CD003179,"We included 26 studies (21,704 participants). Moderate-quality evidence found that adrenaline increased survival to hospital discharge compared to placebo (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.86; 2 studies, 8538 participants; an increase from 23 to 32 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 42). We are uncertain about survival to hospital discharge for high-dose compared to standard-dose adrenaline (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.62; participants = 6274; studies = 10); an increase from 33 to 36 per 1000, 95% CI 24 to 53); standard-dose adrenaline versus vasopressin (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.85; 6 studies; 2511 participants; an increase from 72 to 90 per 1000, 95% CI 60 to 133); and standard-dose adrenaline versus vasopressin plus adrenaline (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22; 3 studies; 3242 participants; a possible decrease from 24 to 18 per 1000, 95% CI 11 to 29), due to very low-quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence found that adrenaline compared with placebo increased survival to hospital admission (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.76; 2 studies, 8489 participants; an increase from 83 to 209 per 1000, 95% CI 139 to 313). We are uncertain about survival to hospital admission when comparing standard-dose with high-dose adrenaline, due to very low-quality evidence. Vasopressin may improve survival to hospital admission when compared with standard-dose adrenaline (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.54; 3 studies, 1953 participants; low-quality evidence; an increase from 260 to 330 per 1000, 95% CI 270 to 400), and may make little or no difference when compared to standard-dose adrenaline plus vasopressin (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08; 3 studies; 3249 participants; low-quality evidence; a decrease from 218 to 207 per 1000 (95% CI 181 to 236). There was no evidence that adrenaline (any dose) or vasopressin improved neurological outcomes. The rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was higher for standard-dose adrenaline versus placebo (RR 2.86, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.71; participants = 8663; studies = 3); moderate-quality evidence; an increase from 115 to 329 per 1000, 95% CI 254 to 427). We are uncertain about the effect on ROSC for the comparison of standard-dose versus high-dose adrenaline and standard-does adrenaline compared to vasopressin, due to very low-quality evidence. Standard-dose adrenaline may make little or no difference to ROSC when compared to standard-dose adrenaline plus vasopressin (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; 3 studies, 3249 participants; low-quality evidence; a possible decrease from 299 to 290 per 1000, 95% CI 260 to 323).

The other 11 studies were funded by organisations such as research foundations and government funding bodies. This review provides moderate-quality evidence that standard-dose adrenaline compared to placebo improves return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission and survival to hospital discharge, but low-quality evidence that it did not affect survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Very low -quality evidence found that high-dose adrenaline compared to standard-dose adrenaline improved return of spontaneous circulation and survival to admission. Vasopressin compared to standard dose adrenaline improved survival to admission but not return of spontaneous circulation, whilst the combination of adrenaline and vasopressin compared with adrenaline alone had no effect on these outcomes. Neither standard dose adrenaline, high-dose adrenaline,vasopressin nor a combination of adrenaline and vasopressin improved survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Many of these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago. Treatment has changed in recent years, so the findings from older studies may not reflect current practice.","We identified 26 randomised controlled trials, involving 21,704 participants, that examined the effect of adrenaline or vasopressin on survival after cardiac arrest that occurred in and out of hospital and in adults and children. Some studies compared adrenaline in standard doses with placebo (dummy medication); some examined standard-dose versus high-dose adrenaline; and others compared vasopressin alone or vasopressin plus adrenaline to standard doses of adrenaline. The source of funding was not stated in 11 of the 26 studies. The study drugs were provided by the manufacturer in four of the 26 studies, but neither drug represents a profitable commercial option. The other 11 studies were funded by organisations such as research foundations and government funding bodies. The studies found evidence that adrenaline was effective at restarting the heart and helping people recover enough to go home from hospital. However, there was no evidence that any of the drugs improved survival with a good neurological outcome. The overall quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate (for studies comparing adrenaline to placebo), but mainly low or very low for the other comparisons, due to risks of bias within the studies. Many of these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago. Treatment has changed in recent years, so the findings from older studies may not reflect current practice. The studies examined the drugs in many different situations (in and outside of hospitals, at different dosages, and in both adults and children), which may make combining findings misleading."
CD006145,"For this update we identified a total of 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies). A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. In relation to diagnosis, we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast and prostate cancer but not for those with haematological malignancies. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance. The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention.","A number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of exercise both during and after treatment. The current review was carried out to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on fatigue related to cancer. Fifty-six studies, involving a total of 4068 participants, were included in this review. Results suggest that physical exercise such as aerobic walking and aerobic cycling can help to reduce fatigue both during and after treatment for cancer. The benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed specifically for people with breast cancer and prostate cancer."
CD010415,"We identified 21 studies for inclusion in the review: 20 controlled before-after (CBA) studies and one interrupted time series (ITS) study. These evaluated a range of infrastructure including cycle lanes, advanced stop lines, use of colour, cycle tracks, cycle paths, management of the road network, speed management, cycle routes and networks, roundabout design and packages of measures. No studies reported medically-attended or self-reported injuries. There was no evidence that cycle lanes reduce the rate of cycle collisions (rate ratio 1.21, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.08). Taking into account cycle flow, there was no difference in collisions for cyclists using cycle routes and networks compared with cyclists not using cycle routes and networks (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.05). There was statistically significant heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 75%, Chi² = 8.00 df = 2, P = 0.02) for the analysis adjusted for cycle flow. We judged the quality of the evidence regarding cycle routes and networks as very low and we are very uncertain about the estimate. These analyses are based on findings from CBA studies. From data presented narratively, the use of 20 mph speed restrictions in urban areas may be effective at reducing cyclist collisions. Redesigning specific parts of cycle routes that may be particularly busy or complex in terms of traffic movement may be beneficial to cyclists in terms of reducing the risk of collision. Generally, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts may increase the number of cycle collisions. In particular, the conversion of intersections to roundabouts with cycle lanes marked as part of the circulating carriageway increased cycle collisions. However, the conversion of intersections with and without signals to roundabouts with cycle paths may reduce the odds of collision. Both continuing a cycle lane across the mouth of a side road with a give way line onto the main road, and cycle tracks, may increase the risk of injury collisions in cyclists. However, these conclusions are uncertain, being based on a narrative review of findings from included studies. There is a lack of evidence that cycle paths or advanced stop lines either reduce or increase injury collisions in cyclists. There is also insufficient evidence to draw any robust conclusions concerning the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions in terms of severity of injury, sex, age, and level of social deprivation of the casualty. In terms of quality of the evidence, there was little matching of intervention and control sites. In many studies, the comparability of the control area to the intervention site was unclear and few studies provided information on other cycling infrastructures that may be in place in the control and intervention areas. The majority of studies analysed data routinely collected by organisations external to the study team, thus reducing the risk of bias in terms of systematic differences in assessing outcomes between the control and intervention groups. Some authors did not take regression-to-mean effects into account when examining changes in collisions. Longer data collection periods pre- and post-installation would allow for regression-to-mean effects and also seasonal and time trends in traffic volume to be observed. Few studies adjusted cycle collision rates for exposure. Generally, there is a lack of high quality evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions as to the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions. There is a lack of rigorous evaluation of cycling infrastructure.","The types of studies that could be included in this review are randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted times series studies. We found 21 studies looking at the effects of 11 different types of cycling infrastructure. No studies reported self-reported injuries or medically attended injuries. Fourteen studies reported police-reported ‘cycle crashes’ or ‘accidents’ or ‘injury crashes’ and the other studies reported outcomes such as number of “cycle accidents” or “crashes involving cyclists”. Nine studies reported collisions by severity; seven studies reported on age of casualty; and two studies reported on sex. One study reported on the level of social deprivation. Cycle flow was collected in 14 studies. Generally we found a lack of evidence that the types of cycling infrastructure we looked at affects injuries or collisions in cyclists. Cycle routes and networks do not seem to reduce the risk of collision. Speed limits of 20 mph, changing parts of the road network to some designs of roundabouts and changing busy parts of a cycle route may reduce the risk of collision. In terms of severity of injury, sex, age and level of social deprivation of the area, there is a lack of evidence to draw any conclusions concerning the effect of cycling infrastructure on cycling collisions. We carried out a thorough search for relevant papers. The quality of the evidence was low with 20 of the included 21 studies using a controlled before-after study design. Few studies considered how factors such as weather and volume of traffic may affect collision rates. Few studies considered how changes in cycle rates seen as a result of installing infrastructure may affect changes in collision rates."
CD009446,"We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods. Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants). There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids. We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence). In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment. Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence). Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term. There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment. Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective. Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable. Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance. Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects. Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.","We included 36 randomised controlled trials with 2706 participants, examining the effect of anti-inflammatory treatments on seborrhoeic dermatitis. These trials were short-term; most of them lasting four weeks or less. Topical steroid treatment (such as hydrocortisone and betamethasone), topical calcineurin inhibitor treatment (such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), and topical lithium salts all reduced the symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis when compared with placebo treatment. Mild (such as hydrocortisone 1%) and strong (such as betamethasone) steroid compounds were comparable in short-term follow up. Short-term total clearance was achieved with antifungal azole treatment (such as ketoconazole and miconazole), as well as with steroids. Strong steroids were better than azole treatment in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus, and were comparable in terms of safety. Steroids were also as effective as calcineurin inhibitors, but side-effects occurred more often with calcineurin inhibitors. We found no differences between calcineurin inhibitors and azole treatments in effectiveness or side-effects. Lithium was more effective than azoles but had a similar frequency of side-effects (one study). The most common side-effects were burning, itching, erythema, and dryness in all treatment groups. Topical anti-inflammatory agents are useful in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis. Steroids are the most investigated anti-inflammatories. We still do not know the effects and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments in long-term or continuous use. This is regrettable as the disease is chronic in nature. Furthermore, there are no data concerning the effects of different treatments on quality of life."
CD007726,"We included 10 studies involving 632 participants. One new trial (19 participants) was added for this update. One trial was conducted in a community setting, eight in nursing homes and one in both settings. Different types of antipsychotics at varying doses were discontinued in the studies. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. Reported data were predominantly from studies at low or unclear risk of bias. We included nine trials with 575 randomised participants that used a proxy outcome for overall success of antipsychotic withdrawal. Pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Based on assessment of seven studies, discontinuation may make little or no difference to whether or not participants complete the study (low-quality evidence). Two trials included only participants with psychosis, agitation or aggression who had responded to antipsychotic treatment. In these two trials, stopping antipsychotics was associated with a higher risk of leaving the study early due to symptomatic relapse or a shorter time to symptomatic relapse. We found low-quality evidence that discontinuation may make little or no difference to overall NPS, measured using various scales (7 trials, 519 participants). There was some evidence from subgroup analyses in two trials that discontinuation may reduce agitation for participants with less severe NPS at baseline, but may be associated with a worsening of NPS in participants with more severe NPS at baseline. None of the studies assessed withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects of antipsychotics (such as falls) were not systematically assessed. Low-quality evidence showed that discontinuation may have little or no effect on adverse events (5 trials, 381 participants), quality of life (2 trials, 119 participants), or cognitive function (5 trials, 365 participants). There were insufficient data to determine whether discontinuation of antipsychotics has any effect on mortality (very low-quality evidence). There is low-quality evidence that antipsychotics may be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and NPS who have been taking antipsychotics for at least three months, and that discontinuation may have little or no important effect on behavioural and psychological symptoms. This is consistent with the observation that most behavioural complications of dementia are intermittent and often do not persist for longer than three months. Discontinuation may have little or no effect on overall cognitive function. Discontinuation may make no difference to adverse events and quality of life. Based on the trials in this review, we are uncertain whether discontinuation of antipsychotics leads to a decrease in mortality. People with psychosis, aggression or agitation who responded well to long-term antipsychotic drug use, or those with more severe NPS at baseline, may benefit behaviourally from continuation of antipsychotics. Discontinuation may reduce agitation for people with mild NPS at baseline. However, these conclusions are based on few studies or small subgroups and further evidence of benefits and harms associated with withdrawal of antipsychotic is required in people with dementia and mild and severe NPS. The overall conclusions of the review have not changed since 2013 and the number of available trials remains low.","Overall, evidence was low- or very low-quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. Limited evidence suggests that stopping long-term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low."
CD007750,"Two studies (involving 286 women) from amniocentesis (but none from CVS) compared the impact of communicating results of rapid testing with waiting for definitive karyotype. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform pooled analysis because one study reported only median (interquartile range) data, presumably because the data were not normally distributed. One study reported a statistically significant reduction in the average anxiety during the waiting period for women who had had a rapid test compared with those who had not (mean difference (MD) -2.30, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -3.08 to - 1.52). The other study compared median (interquartile range) for the trait- and state-anxiety scores and found no difference between the two groups. We found no conclusive evidence that, while waiting for the full karyotype following amniocentesis, issuing results from a rapid analysis reduces maternal anxiety. The limited evidence from the two trials included in this review does not help resolve the dilemma about whether full karyotyping should be abandoned in favour of limited rapid testing for women undergoing Down's syndrome screening. This choice will rest on clinical arguments and cost-effectiveness rather than impact on anxiety. There is also no evidence to support the view that issuing amniocentesis results as soon as they are available is more user friendly than using a pre-defined fixed date. Studies evaluating the effect of different strategies for disclosing results on women anxiety for CVS are needed.","One study reported a statistically significant reduction in the average anxiety during the waiting period for women who had had a rapid test, but the other found no difference between the two groups. There was also no evidence to support the view that issuing amniocentesis results as soon as they are available is more user friendly than informing women on a pre-defined fixed date. The results remain inconclusive and, therefore, for the time being the choice of communication strategies should be influenced by clinical arguments and cost-effectiveness rather than impact on anxiety. Studies evaluating the effect of different strategies for disclosing results on women anxiety for chorionic villous sampling are needed."
CD010277,"We included three new RCTs for this update, for a total of six included RCTs involving 559 children aged from 29 days to 12 years with pneumonia who were treated as inpatients. Pneumonia severity was described as moderate in one trial, severe in two trials, and was not stated in three trials. The studies assessed five different interventions: effects of conventional chest physiotherapy (3 studies, 211 children), positive expiratory pressure (1 study, 72 children), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (1 study, 94 children), bubble CPAP (bCPAP) (1 study, 225 children), and assisted autogenic drainage (1 studies, 29 children). The included studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Blinding of participants was not possible in most studies, but we considered that the outcomes were unlikely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. One study of bCPAP reported that three deaths occurred in children in the physiotherapy group (N = 79), and 20 deaths in the control group (N = 146) (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.90; 225 children; low-quality evidence). One study of assisted autogenic drainage (N = 29), and one study of conventional chest physiotherapy (N = 72) reported no deaths occurred. It is uncertain whether chest physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) reduced hospital stay duration (days) (mean difference (MD) 0.10, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.76; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). There was variation among clinical parameters used to define clinical resolution. Two small studies found no difference in resolution of fever between children in the physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy and assisted autogenic drainage) and control groups. Of five studies that considered peripheral oxygen saturation levels, only two reported that use of chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy) showed a greater improvement in peripheral oxygen saturation levels. However, it was unclear whether respiratory rate (breaths/min) improved after conventional chest physiotherapy (MD -2.25, 95% CI -5.17 to 0.68; 2 studies, 122 children; low-quality evidence). Two studies assessed adverse events (number of events), but only one study reported any events (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.67; 2 studies, 254 children; low-quality evidence). We could draw no reliable conclusions concerning the use of chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia due to the small number of included trials with differing study characteristics and statistical presentation of data. Future studies should consider the following key points: appropriate sample size with adequate power to detect expected differences, standardisation of chest physiotherapy techniques, appropriate outcomes (such as duration of leukocytosis, and airway clearance), and adverse effects.","We included six studies involving 559 children with pneumonia aged from 29 days to 12 years. This is an update of a review published in 2013 and includes three new studies. Studies were conducted in hospitals in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. Pneumonia was described as moderate to severe in three studies, but severity was not described in three studies. All studies included children who received physiotherapy and others who did not. All children also received standard medical treatment for pneumonia. The studies assessed deaths, length of hospital stay, time taken to attain normal test results (no signs of pneumonia), and adverse events. Four studies reported sources of funding (a child health agency, university, government research grants), and two did not report study funding sources. One study reported fewer deaths in children who received bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP). Physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) were not associated with shorter hospital stays. Two studies reported improvements in blood oxygen levels after chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy). No clear improvement in respiratory rate was observed after conventional chest physiotherapy. Based on the available evidence, we could not confirm if chest physiotherapy is beneficial or not for children with pneumonia. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence as low due to inadequate study methods and design, differing results among studies, and few data."
CD009950,"Three short-term RCTs, which enrolled 277 randomised participants with acute phase GBS, were included. Risk of bias in the included studies was generally unclear due to insufficient information. None of the included studies reported the primary outcome selected for this review, which was number of patients with self reported pain relief of 50% or greater. One small study investigated seven-day regimens of gabapentin versus placebo. Pain was rated on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). Amongst the 18 participants, significantly lower mean pain scores were found at the endpoint (day 7) in the gabapentin phase compared to the endpoint of the placebo phase (mean difference -3.61, 95% CI -4.12 to -3.10) (very low quality evidence). For adverse events, no significant differences were found in the incidence of nausea (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04) or constipation (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.54). A second study enrolling 36 participants compared gabapentin, carbamazepine and placebo, all administered over seven days. Participants in the gabapentin group had significantly lower median pain scores on all treatment days in comparison to the placebo and carbamazepine groups (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the median pain scores between the carbamazepine and placebo groups from day 1 to day 3, but from day 4 until the end of the study significantly lower median pain scores were noted in the carbamazepine group (P < 0.05) (very low quality evidence). There were no adverse effects of gabapentin or carbamazepine reported, other than sedation. One large RCT (223 participants, all also treated with intravenous immunoglobulin), compared a five-day course of methylprednisolone with placebo and found no statistically significant differences in number of participants developing pain (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.16), number of participants with decreased pain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.42) or number of participants with increased pain (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.41) (low quality evidence). The study did not report whether there were any adverse events. Since the last version of this review we found no new studies. While management of pain in GBS is essential and pharmacotherapy is widely accepted as being an important component of treatment, this review does not provide sufficient evidence to support the use of any pharmacological intervention in people with pain in GBS. Although reductions in pain severity were found when comparing gabapentin and carbamazepine with placebo, the evidence was limited and its quality very low. Larger, well-designed RCTs are required to further investigate the efficacy and safety of potential interventions for patients with pain in GBS. Additionally, interventions for pain in the convalescent phase of GBS should be investigated.","We first carried out a wide search of medical databases to find studies that met the requirements for this review. We identified three studies, which involved 277 participants who were randomly assigned to different treatments for pain in GBS. Two studies compared a pain medicine (gabapentin or carbamazepine) with placebo (inactive treatment). The other study compared a steroid medicine with placebo. Two medicines, gabapentin and carbamazepine, reduced pain severity compared to placebo (inactive) treatment and they had few side effects. One study found that people taking gabapentin had less pain, sleepiness or need for additional pain killers than those given carbamazepine. However, these studies were small and the treatment period was short. One trial, with 223 participants, found that methylprednisolone, which is a steroid medicine, did not affect the numbers of people who developed pain or change the numbers with more pain or less pain compared with placebo. This study did not report whether there were any side effects. This review does not provide enough evidence to say whether or not treatments for pain in people with GBS work. Although both gabapentin and carbamazepine reduced the severity of pain compared to placebo, and few side effects were reported, the studies were small and the quality of the evidence was very low. Much larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm that drug treatments are safe and effective for people with pain in the period soon after onset of GBS. Long-term studies of pain treatments at the stage when people with GBS are recovering should also be conducted and these should include assessment of effects of pain treatments on quality of life. This review was first published in 2013 and an updated search in 2014 revealed no additional studies. The evidence is current to November 2014."
CD007248,"One open-label randomised controlled trial of 63 neonates was eligible for inclusion. Thirty-three neonates in the propofol group were compared to 30 infants in the morphine-atropine-suxamethonium group. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of infants who required multiple intubation attempts (39% in the propofol group versus 57% in the morphine-atropine-suxamethonium group; RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.29). Times required to prepare medication, to complete the procedure and for recovery to previous clinical status were shorter in the propofol group. No difference in clinically significant side effects was observed; however, the number of events was small. No practice recommendation can be made based on the available evidence regarding the use of propofol in neonates. Further research is needed on the pharmacokinetics of propofol in neonates and once a relatively safe dose is identified, randomised controlled trials assessing the safety and efficacy of propofol are needed.","Its use in newborn babies is studied in only one study of 63 babies. Propofol helped to reduce time to complete procedure, time of recovery and time to prepare drugs. However, with this small number of newborns studied, the safety can not be proven. Further studies are warranted."
CD009038,"We included one double-blind, double-dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives. The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.","We did a computer search for randomized controlled trials comparing four-phase birth control pills with one-phase birth control pills. We also wrote to researchers and makers of birth control pills to find other trials. Studies had to report on pregnancy, bleeding problems, side effects or stopping the use of pills. We did not include studies where the pills were used as a treatment for disorders like acne, hirsutism, polycystic ovary syndrome, bleeding problems or endometrioses, or where the pills were administered for less than three months. We assessed whether the studies were conducted properly. We included one study comparing a four-phase pill composed of the progestogen dienogest and the estrogen estradiol valerate with an one-phase pill composed of the progestogen levonorgestrel and the estrogen ethinylestradiol. Four-phase birth control pills and one-phase birth control pills had similar pregnancy rates. The number of women with blood loss in the period between two menstruations was similar for four-phase pills and one-phase pills. More women using one-phase birth control pills had a menstruation compared to women using four-phase birth control pills. The number of women who stopped using the pills because of side effects was similar for four-phase pills and one-phase pills. Breast pain was reported more frequently by women who used four-phase birth control pills than women who used one-phase birth control pills. The presence of only one study made it impossible to adequately compare four-phase birth control pills with one-phase birth control pills. More studies are needed to determine whether four-phase pills have advantages over one-phase pills. Until then, we recommend one-phase pills containing 30 μg estrogen for women starting to use birth control pills."
CD001784,"Four trials involving 1873 participants, heterogeneous with respect to aetiology of ED, were included. Study design was two cross-over and two parallel group trials. Only the latter provided adequate data for meta-analyses. PGE1 was effective during follow-up in the ""at least one successful intercourse"" outcome (Peto Odds Ratio, OR 7.22, 95% CI. 5.68-9.18) . One cross-over study reported ""at least one successful intercourse"" in 63.6% of participants with at least one dose of PGE1 (P < 0.01 for each active dose versus placebo). In the other cross-over study, only one of three treatment groups conducted a self-evaluation (55.5%: ""good"" or ""excellent"" response). Adverse effects were most frequent in the treated groups and occurred more often and intensely as doses increased. Penile pain (Peto OR 7.39, 95% CI. 5.40-10.12) and minor urethral trauma (Peto OR 3.79, 95% CI. 1.88-7.65) were predominant. PGE1 was beneficial for many participants with ED of different aetiology. Adverse effects were proportional to dosage, albeit never serious. The use of PGE1 in ED could have been better interpreted if its effectiveness were compared by aetiology and with different forms of administrations, a longer follow-up were considered and more emphasis given to patient/partner relationships and quality of life.","The review of trials found that men using PGE1 reported more satisfactory sexual experiences. Higher doses gave greater benefits but also increased the adverse effects. The most common adverse effect is some pain, and men may prefer the urethral medication rather than injections."
CD007037,"We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta-blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta-blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta-blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta-analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta-blockers. However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co-morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta-blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta-analyses. There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta-blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta-blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta-blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","This review summarises and discusses the available information on the use of beta-blockers in children with congestive heart failure. Seven studies, with a total of 420 children were included in the review. Beta-blocker therapy improved heart failure in four small studies with less than 30 participants each, and two larger studies with 80 participants each. However, the largest trial, with 161 participants, did not show a significant effect of the investigated beta-blocker over placebo. None of the studies reported any severe beta-blocker-related adverse events, apart from one child who had a heart rhythm disturbance. There were not enough data to recommend or discourage the use of beta-blockers in children with congestive heart failure. However, the current available data suggest that children with heart failure might benefit from beta-blocker treatment. Further investigations are required to establish guidelines for therapy."
CD003626,"Eight trials evaluated ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention (592 patients). The eight randomised clinical trials have a high risk of bias. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median three years). The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid used in the trials ranged from low (10 mg/kg body weight/day) to high (28 to 30 mg/kg body weight/day). Ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.20); treatment failure including liver transplantation, varices, ascites, and encephalopathy (RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64); liver histological deterioration (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.74); or liver cholangiographic deterioration (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.57). Ursodeoxycholic acid significantly improved serum bilirubin (MD -14.6 µmol/litre; 95% CI -18.7 to -10.6), alkaline phosphatases (MD -506 IU/litre; 95% CI -583 to -430), aspartate aminotransferase (MD -46 IU/litre; 95% CI -77 to -16), and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (MD -260 IU/litre; 95% CI -315 to -205), but not albumin (MD -0.20 g/litre; 95% CI -1.91 to 1.50). Ursodeoxycholic acid was safe and well tolerated by patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. We did not find enough evidence to support or refute the use of bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, bile acids seem to lead to a significant improvement in liver biochemistry. Therefore, more randomised trials are needed before any of the bile acids can be recommended for this indication.","Based on eight randomised clinical trials of high risk of bias, the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid to patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis did not significantly reduce mortality, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation, liver histological deterioration, or radiological deterioration compared with placebo or no intervention. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid showed a statistically significant improvement of liver biochemistry. However, evidence of these beneficial effects is weak as it is produced from trials with high risk of bias and a rather small number of patients. Furthermore, these observations are at risk of outcome measure reporting bias as half or less than half of the trials reported on these outcomes. One trial assessed the self-estimated quality of life of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. No significant difference was found in any of the studied components, physical as well as mental. Based on an analysis of six of the eight included trials, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid seemed safe and well tolerated, without reports of serious adverse events. We were unable to identify trials evaluating other bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Accordingly, the evidence does neither support nor refute bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis."
CD011020,"Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review. Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech-language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. Risk of bias
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology-based intervention versus placebo
Results from meta-analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.66 to -0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. Primary outcome 2: Memory
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight-week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. Secondary outcomes
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta-analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference -5.59, 95% CI -11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). This review provides low-quality evidence for the use of technology-based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","We identified four studies (including 206 participants) that investigated the effectiveness of technology-based interventions to rehabilitate children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury. All four studies were conducted in North America, with three originating from the same research team. One study with 120 participants used an online Counselor-Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) intervention to rehabilitate executive functioning in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. One study with 35 participants used a Teen Online Problem-Solving intervention to target the executive functioning of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. One study with 40 participants used an online Family Problem Solving intervention to target outcomes such as behaviour and aspects of executive functioning in children aged 5 to 16 years. One study with 12 participants used a computer program to target cognitive-communication skills including memory and aspects of executive functions in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years. All funding sources were in the USA or Canada. One study was funded by the Colorado Department of Human Services and two National Institutes of Health (NIH) awards. A second study was also funded by a NIH grant. One study was funded by a hospital charity in addition to the Easter Seal Research Institute and Apple Canada. The final study was supported by the Ohio Department of Safety. This review found evidence that interventions employing technological aids did improve executive functions in adolescents with traumatic brain injury (i.e. a brain injury resulting from a road traffic accident, fall, or blow to the head). However, this result was relatively modest and is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the child. One study employed technology to improve memory in adolescents with TBI and showed an improvement for the intervention group. It was not possible to determine how effective this approach was as the study failed to include adequate statistical information. Two studies examined the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression but did not show any effect between the intervention and control groups at 6 months follow-up. Only one study recorded adverse events, and reported that none occurred. Two studies reported on the amount of use the intervention received. One study reported improvements in social functioning/social competence for the intervention group. No data were reported which related to the review's other secondary outcomes. We found the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be low, which means future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. All four studies were small, and it was not always possible to conceal group allocation to participants. Three studies failed to conceal group allocation to those who measured the outcomes."
CD001177,"Six trials (343 participants) evaluated Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream for the pain associated with ulcer debridement. The between-group difference in pain measured on a 100 mm scale was statistically significant in favour of EMLA (MD -20.65, 95% CI -12.19 to -29.11). No significant between-group differences in burning or itching were observed. Two trials (470 participants with venous leg ulcers) evaluated ibuprofen slow-release foam dressings for persistent venous leg ulcer pain. Compared with local best practice, significantly more participants in the ibuprofen dressing group achieved the outcome of >50% of the total maximum pain relief score between day 1 and day 5 than participants in the local best practice group (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.15). The number needed to treat was 6 (95% CI 4 to 12). In the second trial, compared with an identical non-ibuprofen foam dressing, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing slight to complete pain relief on the first evening of treatment.Limited data were available to assess healing rates or adverse events. There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers. Further research should consider standardised pain assessment methods and assess both the effect on ulcer healing and the impact of long term use of these treatments.","Two trials tested a dressing containing ibuprofen, however, the pain measures and time frames reported were different. One trial indicated that pain relief achieved over 5 days with ibuprofen dressings could represent a clinically relevant reduction in pain. The other trial found no significant difference in the chance of pain relief, measured on the first night of treatment, for ibuprofen dressings compared with foam dressings. This trial, however, was small and participants were only followed for a few weeks, which may not be long enough to assess whether the dressing affects healing. There was evidence from five trials that a local anaesthetic cream (EMLA 5%) reduces the post-procedural pain of debriding leg ulcers but there was insufficient evidence regarding any side effects of this cream and its impact on healing."
CD006254,"Eighteen studies (7446 participants) compared cinacalcet in addition to standard therapy with no treatment or placebo plus standard therapy. In adults with GFR category G5 (GFR below 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) treated with dialysis, routine cinacalcet treatment had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.05), imprecise effects on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.87), and prevented surgical parathyroidectomy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59) and hypercalcaemia (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.97), but increased hypocalcaemia (RR 6.98, 95% CI 5.10 to 9.53), nausea (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.81) and vomiting (RR 1.97, 95% CI 95% CI 1.73 to 2.24). Cinacalcet decreased serum PTH (MD -281.39 pg/mL, 95% CI -325.84 to -234.94) and calcium (MD -0.87 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.77) levels, but had little or no effect on serum phosphorous levels (MD -0.23 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.12). Data were sparse for adults with GFR categories G3a to G4 (GFR 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and kidney transplant recipients. Overall, based on GRADE criteria, evidence for cinacalcet in adults with GFR category G5 treated with dialysis (mortality, parathyroidectomy, hypocalcaemia, and nausea) is of high or moderate quality. High quality evidence suggests ""further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect"" and moderate quality evidence is ""further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate"". Information for adults with less severe CKD GFR category G3a to G4 is of low or very low quality. This means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate Routine cinacalcet therapy reduced the need for parathyroidectomy in adults treated with dialysis and elevated PTH levels but does not improve all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Cinacalcet increases risks of nausea, vomiting and hypocalcaemia, suggesting harms may outweigh benefits in this population.","A newer treatment called cinacalcet showed promise for improving abnormal mineral levels but the effects of this drug on patient outcomes (the way patients feel function and survive) were unclear from early studies. We have updated an earlier review dated 2006 to include studies that assessed the effects of cinacalcet in about 7500 people with chronic kidney disease. While cinacalcet improves some blood abnormalities, it does not improve risk of death or heart disease in people treated with dialysis. In addition, people who take cinacalcet may experience increased nausea, vomiting and the need for blood tests to check blood calcium levels. The current research is high-quality and means that additional new studies are unlikely to change our confidence in these results. Information for the use of cinacalcet in people with milder forms of kidney disease and those with a kidney transplant is insufficient to guide decision making."
CD002843,"We included 26 trials (17,578 participants, 9015 women and 8563 men). Five trials were conducted in developing countries. Only two trials were conducted among HIV-positive patients. There was potential for selection bias, owing to the methods of allocation used and of performance bias, owing to the lack of blinding in most included studies. Seven trials had attrition of greater than 20%, increasing the risk of bias. The review found moderate-quality evidence that expedited partner therapy is better than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of index patients when combining trials of STIs that caused urethritis or cervicitis (6 trials; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89, I2 = 39%). When studies with attrition greater than 20% were excluded, the effect of expedited partner therapy was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04, I2 = 0%). In trials restricted to index patients with chlamydia, the effect was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35, I2 = 22%). Expedited partner therapy also increased the number of partners treated per index patient (three trials) when compared with simple patient referral in people with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.58) or trichomonas (MD 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67), and people with any STI syndrome (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.67). Expedited partner therapy was not superior to enhanced patient referral in preventing re-infection (3 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.53, I2 = 33%, low-quality evidence). Home sampling kits for partners (four trials) did not result in lower rates of re-infection in the index case (measured in one trial), or higher numbers of partners elicited (three trials), notified (two trials) or treated (one trial) when compared with simple patient referral. There was no consistent evidence for the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods. In one trial among men with non-gonococcal urethritis, more partners were treated with provider referral than with simple patient referral (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63). In one study among people with syphilis, contract referral elicited treatment of more partners than provider referral (MD 2.2, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.45), but the number of partners receiving treatment was the same in both groups. Where measured, there was no statistical evidence of differences in the incidence of adverse effects between PN strategies. The evidence assessed in this review does not identify a single optimal strategy for PN for any particular STI. When combining trials of STI causing urethritis or cervicitis, expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of the index patient but was not superior to enhanced patient referral. Expedited partner therapy interventions should include all components that were part of the trial intervention package. There was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective components of an enhanced patient referral strategy. There are too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods for different STIs. More high-quality RCTs of PN strategies for HIV and syphilis, using biological outcomes, are needed.","A review update of the research of the strategies of partner notification in people with STI, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was conducted by researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 26 studies. This review covers four main PN strategies: 1) Patient referral means that the patient tells their sexual partners that they need to be treated, either with (enhanced) or without (simple) additional support to enhance outcomes. 2) Expedited partner therapy means that the patient delivers medication or a prescription for medication to their partner(s) without the need for a medical examination of the partner. 3) Provider referral means that health service personnel notify the partners. 4) Contract referral means that the patient is encouraged to notify partners but health service personnel will contact them if they do not visit the health service by a certain date. The 26 trials in this review included 17,578 participants. Five trials were conducted in developing countries and only two trials were performed among HIV-positive patients. Expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral in reducing repeat infection in patients with gonorrhoea, chlamydia or non-gonococcal urethritis (six trials). Expedited partner therapy and enhanced patient referral resulted in similar levels of repeat infection (three trials). Evidence about the effects of home sampling, where patients with chlamydia received a sample kit for the partner, was inconsistent (three trials). There were too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods for different STIs. More studies need to be performed on HIV and syphilis and harms need to be measured and reported."
CD013169,"We included six RCTs (all assessing CPAP as the non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy device), with a total of 315 men with OSAS and ED. All RCTs presented some important risk of bias related to selection, performance, assessment, or reporting bias. None of included RCTs assessed the ED remission rate, and we used the provided ED mean scores as a proxy. CPAP versus no CPAP
There is uncertainty about the effect of CPAP on mean ED scores after 4 weeks, using the International index of erectile function (IIEF-5, higher = better; MD 7.50, 95% CI 4.05 to 10.95; 1 RCT; 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and after 12 weeks (IIEF-ED, ED domain; MD 2.50, 95% CI -1.10 to 6.10; 1 RCT; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). There is uncertainty about the effect of CPAP on sex-related quality of life after 12 weeks, using the Self-esteem and relationship test (SEAR, higher = better; MD 1.00, 95% CI -8.09 to 10.09; 1 RCT; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision); no serious adverse events were reported after 4 weeks (1 RCT; 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). CPAP versus sham CPAP
One RCT assessed this comparison (61 participants), but we were unable to extract outcomes for this comparison due to the factorial design and reporting of this trial. CPAP versus sildenafil (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors)
Sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks when compared to CPAP, measured with the IIEF-ED (MD -4.78, 95% CI -6.98 to -2.58; 3 RCTs; 152 participants; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations). There is uncertainty about the effect of CPAP on sex-related quality of life after 12 weeks, measured with the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction questionnaire (EDITS, higher = better; MD -1.24, 95% CI -1.80 to -0.67; 2 RCTs; 122 participants; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations). No serious adverse events were reported for either group (2 RCTs; 70 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). There is uncertainty about the effects of CPAP when compared to sildenafil for the incidence of minor adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.21; 1 RCT; 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). The confidence interval was wide and neither a significant increase nor reduction in the risk of minor adverse events can be ruled out with the use of CPAP (4/20 men complained of nasal dryness in the CPAP group, and 3/20 men complained of transient flushing and mild headache in the sildenafil group). When compared with no CPAP, we are uncertain about the effectiveness and acceptability of CPAP for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea. When compared with sildenafil, there is some evidence that sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks.","We included six studies, that included 315 men with OSAS and ED. They compared the use of CPAP with either: no CPAP; with sham device (a device similar to CPAP without positive pressure, as a placebo); or with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (first-line oral medications for the treatment of ED), for at least month. We evaluated the following primary outcomes (remission of ED and serious adverse events); and secondary outcomes (sex-related quality of life, health-related quality of life, and minor adverse events). CPAP device versus no CPAP
We are uncertain about the effects of CPAP on erectile dysfunction after 4 and 12 weeks, and on sex-related quality of life after 12 weeks. None of the groups reported any serious side effects after 12 weeks. CPAP versus sham CPAP
One study (61 participants) compared CPAP with a sham device, but we were unable to analyse data because of the design and reporting of this trial. CPAP versus sildenafil (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors)
Sildenafil may improve erectile function and sex-related quality of health more than CPAP after 12 weeks compared to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (sildenafil). None of the groups reported serious side effects; both groups reported some mild, transient side effects after 12 weeks. We are uncertain about the results, because of limitations in how the studies were conducted, the small sample sizes, and imprecise results."
CD012216,"We included three studies, two of which evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, and one evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. Progression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 448 participants. The studies reported data on 401 participants with 1.6 years of follow-up and in 47 participants with three years of follow-up. Sixty-one (15.2%) participants converted at 1.6 years follow-up; nine (19.1%) participants converted at three years of follow-up. Progression from MCI to any form of dementia was evaluated in five participants with 1.5 years of follow-up, with three (60%) participants converting to any form of dementia. There were concerns regarding applicability in the reference standard in all three studies. Regarding the domain of flow and timing, two studies were considered at high risk of bias. MCI to ADD;
Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow-up between two to less than four years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 30 to 93) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) by visual assessment (n = 47, 1 study). Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow-up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 78 to 95) and a specificity of 58% (95% CI 53 to 64) by visual assessment, and a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76 to 94) and a specificity of 51% (95% CI 45 to 56) by quantitative assessment by the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)(n = 401, 1 study). MCI to any form of dementia;
Progression from MCI to any form of dementia in those with a follow-up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 9 to 99) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI 1 to 99) by visual assessment (n = 5, 1 study). MCI to any other forms of dementia (non-ADD);
There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to any other form of dementia (non-ADD). Although sensitivity was good in one included study, considering the poor specificity and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend routine use of 18F-florbetapir PET in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD. Because of the poor sensitivity and specificity, limited number of included participants, and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. Because of the high financial costs of 18F-florbetapir, clearly demonstrating the DTA and standardising the process of this modality are important prior to its wider use.","The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow-up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow-up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer. The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies. At a follow-up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. We conclude that 18F-florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness."
CD003150,"We included 13 studies with 708 participants. All participants had dementia and in the 12 trials which described the setting, all were resident in institutional care facilities. Nine trials recruited participants because they had significant agitation or other behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) at baseline. The fragrances used were lavender (eight studies); lemon balm (four studies); lavender and lemon balm, lavender and orange, and cedar extracts (one study each). For six trials, assessment of risk of bias and extraction of results was hampered by poor reporting. Four of the other seven trials were at low risk of bias in all domains, but all were small (range 18 to 186 participants; median 66), reducing our confidence in the results. Our primary outcomes were agitation, overall behavioural and psychological symptoms, and adverse effects. Ten trials assessed agitation using various scales. Among the five trials for which our confidence in the results was moderate or low, four trials reported no significant effect on agitation and one trial reported a significant benefit of aromatherapy. The other five trials either reported no useable data or our confidence in the results was very low. Eight trials assessed overall BPSD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and we had moderate or low confidence in the results of five of them. Of these, four reported significant benefit from aromatherapy and one reported no significant effect. Adverse events were poorly reported or not reported at all in most trials. No more than two trials assessed each of our secondary outcomes of quality of life, mood, sleep, activities of daily living, caregiver burden. We did not find evidence of benefit on these outcomes. Three trials assessed cognition: one did not report any data and the other two trials reported no significant effect of aromatherapy on cognition. Our confidence in the results of these studies was low. We have not found any convincing evidence that aromatherapy (or exposure to fragrant plant oils) is beneficial for people with dementia although there are many limitations to the data. Conduct or reporting problems in half of the included studies meant that they could not contribute to the conclusions. Results from the other studies were inconsistent. Harms were very poorly reported in the included studies. In order for clear conclusions to be drawn, better design and reporting and consistency of outcome measurement in future trials would be needed.","We found 13 studies to include in the review. There were 708 participants in total. All had dementia and were living in care homes. The most commonly used aromatherapy fragrance was lavender. Studies also used lemon balm, orange and cedar extracts. Ten studies assessed agitation, but five did not report data we could use or our confidence in their results was very low. We had moderate or low confidence in the results of the other five: four reported no significant effect of aromatherapy and one reported a significant benefit. Eight studies assessed behavioural and mental health issues, but three did not report any usable data, or our confidence in the results was very low. Of the other five, for which our confidence was moderate or low, four reported a significant benefit from aromatherapy and one reported no significant effect. Side effects of treatment were either poorly reported or not reported at all. No more than three studies reported our secondary outcomes which were quality of life, cognition (thinking), mood, sleep, activities of daily living, and caregiver burden. We found no evidence that aromatherapy was helpful for any of these outcomes. Overall the quality of the evidence was poor. Many of the studies were poorly reported and some did not report any data we could use. Most studies were very small so that there was a lot of uncertainty about their results. Results of different studies did not agree with one another. We have found no convincing evidence that aromatherapy is beneficial for people with dementia although there are many limitations to the data reported by the studies so conclusions cannot be drawn with confidence. In order to determine whether aromatherapy is safe and effective at relieving symptoms of dementia, larger, well-designed studies with clearer reporting are needed."
CD001939,"We found 16 randomised clinical trials including 827 participants with hepatic encephalopathy classed as overt (12 trials) or minimal (four trials). Eight trials assessed oral BCAA supplements and seven trials assessed intravenous BCAA. The control groups received placebo/no intervention (two trials), diets (10 trials), lactulose (two trials), or neomycin (two trials). In 15 trials, all participants had cirrhosis. We classed seven trials as low risk of bias and nine trials as high risk of bias (mainly due to lack of blinding or for-profit funding). In a random-effects meta-analysis of mortality, we found no difference between BCAA and controls (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.11; 760 participants; 15 trials; moderate quality of evidence). We found no evidence of small-study effects. Sensitivity analyses of trials with a low risk of bias found no beneficial or detrimental effect of BCAA on mortality. Trial sequential analysis showed that the required information size was not reached, suggesting that additional evidence was needed. BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 827 participants; 16 trials; high quality of evidence). We found no small-study effects and confirmed the beneficial effect of BCAA in a sensitivity analysis that only included trials with a low risk of bias (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). The trial sequential analysis showed that firm evidence was reached. In a fixed-effect meta-analysis, we found that BCAA increased the risk of nausea and vomiting (RR 5.56; 2.93 to 10.55; moderate quality of evidence). We found no beneficial or detrimental effects of BCAA on nausea or vomiting in a random-effects meta-analysis or on quality of life or nutritional parameters. We did not identify predictors of the intervention effect in the subgroup, sensitivity, or meta-regression analyses. In sensitivity analyses that excluded trials with a lactulose or neomycin control, BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.92). Additional sensitivity analyses found no difference between BCAA and lactulose or neomycin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.30). In this updated review, we included five additional trials. The analyses showed that BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy. We found no effect on mortality, quality of life, or nutritional parameters, but we need additional trials to evaluate these outcomes. Likewise, we need additional randomised clinical trials to determine the effect of BCAA compared with interventions such as non-absorbable disaccharides, rifaximin, or other antibiotics.","We identified 16 randomised clinical trials (trials where participants are randomly allocated to treatment groups) including 827 participants. The included people had cirrhosis often due to alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis (liver infection due to a virus). The trials compared BCAA with placebo (a pretend treatment), no intervention, diets, lactulose (a liquid sugar often used to treat constipation), or neomycin (an antibiotic). The evidence is current to October 2014. The analyses found no effect on mortality, but that BCAA had a beneficial effect on symptoms and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. BCAA did not increase the risk of serious adverse events, but was associated with nausea and diarrhoea. When excluding trials on lactulose or neomycin, BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy. When analysing trials with a lactulose or neomycin control, we found no beneficial or detrimental effect of BCAA. We assessed the quality of the evidence to evaluate aspects that can lead to errors in the judgment of intervention effects. We concluded that we had high quality evidence in our analyses about the effect of BCAA on hepatic encephalopathy. We concluded that we had moderate or low quality evidence in the remaining analyses because the number of participants in the trials was too small and the risk of bias (systematic errors) was unclear or high."
CD011349,"We identified 20 studies that had analyzed a total of 1947 eyes of 1866 participants (individual studies ranged from 8 to 346 participants who were randomized). The studies were conducted in eight different countries: one in Brazil, three in China, three in Cuba, one in Egypt, two in Iran, two in Thailand, seven in Turkey, and one in Venezuela. Overall risk of bias was unclear, as many studies did not provide information on randomization methods or masking to prevent performance and detection bias. The risk ratio for recurrence of pterygium using conjunctival autograft versus amniotic membrane transplant was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.77) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.85) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. These estimates include participants with primary and recurrent pterygia. We performed a subgroup analysis to compare participants with primary pterygia with participants with recurrent pterygia. For participants with primary pterygia, the risk ratio was 0.92 (95% CI 0.37 to 2.30) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.27) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. We were only able to estimate the recurrence of pterygia at 6 months for participants with recurrent pterygia, and the risk ratio comparing conjunctival autograft with amniotic membrane transplant was 0.45 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.99). One included study was a doctoral thesis and did not use allocation concealment. When this study was excluded in a sensitivity analysis, the risk ratio for pterygium recurrence at 6 months' follow-up was 0.43 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.62) for participants with primary and recurrent pterygium. One of the secondary outcomes, the proportion of participants with clinical improvement, was analyzed in only one study. This study reported clinical outcome as the risk of non-recurrence, which was seen in 93.8% of participants in the conjunctival limbal autograft group and 93.3% in the amniotic membrane transplant group at 3 months after surgery. We did not analyze data on the need for repeat surgery, vision-related quality of life, and direct and indirect costs of surgery due to an insufficient number of studies reporting these outcomes. Thirteen studies reported adverse events associated with conjunctival autograft surgery and amniotic membrane transplant surgery. Adverse events that occurred in more than one study were granuloma and pyogenic granuloma and increased intraocular pressure. None of the included studies reported that participants had developed induced astigmatism. In association with pterygium excision, conjunctival autograft is associated with a lower risk of recurrence at six months' after surgery than amniotic membrane transplant. Participants with recurrent pterygia in particular have a lower risk of recurrence when they receive conjunctival autograft surgery compared with amniotic membrane transplant. There are few studies comparing the two techniques with respect to visual acuity outcomes, and we identified no studies that reported on vision-related quality of life or direct or indirect costs. Comparison of these two procedures in such outcome measures bears further investigation. There were an insufficient number of studies that used adjunctive mitomycin C to estimate the effects on pterygium recurrence following conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane transplant.","We considered the type of pterygium surgery to be better if it the pterygium returned in a smaller proportion of people at three and six months after the surgery. We searched online databases of published medical articles to find studies that had assigned participants to one of the two surgeries. We included in our review only the studies in which the participants were assigned randomly to their surgery, so that they had an equal chance of being assigned to either one. Study participants could have this growth for the first time (primary pterygium) or could need another surgery because their growth had returned previous surgery. The evidence is current to November 2015. We found 20 studies that compared the two surgeries in a total of 1947 eyes. We combined information from the studies to determine which surgery was better. Six months after surgery, the pterygium returned only one third to over half as often in people who had CAG surgery than in people who had AMT surgery. This difference could not be explained by chance alone. The studies we found did not answer all of our questions. We still want to know the effects of the surgeries on clarity of vision, quality of vision, quality of life and costs. More research studies are needed that answer these questions. The overall quality of the evidence in favor of CAG is low to moderate because of issues in the conduct of the studies and results were sometimes not similar across studies. Future published research may have an impact on the conclusions provided in this review."
CD012142,"We found one eligible trial. Participants were 210 newborn infants with birth weight less than 1251 grams. The trial was unblinded but otherwise of good methodological quality. This trial compared removal of an umbilical venous catheter within 10 days after insertion (and replacement with a peripheral cannula or a percutaneously inserted central catheter as required) versus expectant management (UVC in place up to 28 days). More infants in the early planned removal group than in the expectant management group (83 vs 33) required percutaneous insertion of a central catheter (PICC). Trial results showed no difference in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.22), in hospital mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.98), in catheter-associated thrombus necessitating removal (RR 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 7.94), or in other morbidity. GRADE assessment indicated that the quality of evidence was ""low"" at outcome level principally as the result of imprecision and risk of surveillance bias due to lack of blinding in the included trial. Currently available trial data are insufficient to show whether early planned removal of umbilical venous catheters reduces risk of infection, mortality, or other morbidity in newborn infants. A large, simple, and pragmatic randomised controlled trial is needed to resolve this ongoing uncertainty.","We found only one small randomised controlled trial (including 210 very low birth weight newborn infants) that addressed this question. This trial did not show that early planned removal of UVCs from infants could reduce their chance of developing a bloodstream infection. However, because the trial was small, this finding is not certain. The trial did not provide sufficient evidence to inform policy or practice; larger trials are needed to resolve this question fully."
CD001058,"We included 22 trials, involving 6872 women and babies. The use of antibiotics following PROM is associated with statistically significant reductions in chorioamnionitis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.96, and a reduction in the numbers of babies born within 48 hours (average RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.87) and seven days of randomisation (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89). The following markers of neonatal morbidity were reduced: neonatal infection (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85), use of surfactant (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96), oxygen therapy (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96), and abnormal cerebral ultrasound scan prior to discharge from hospital (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98). Co-amoxiclav was associated with an increased risk of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (RR 4.72, 95% CI 1.57 to 14.23). One study evaluated the children's health at seven years of age (ORACLE Children Study) and found antibiotics seemed to have little effect on the health of children. Routine prescription of antibiotics for women with preterm rupture of the membranes is associated with prolongation of pregnancy and improvements in a number of short-term neonatal morbidities, but no significant reduction in perinatal mortality. Despite lack of evidence of longer-term benefit in childhood, the advantages on short-term morbidities are such that we would recommend antibiotics are routinely prescribed. The antibiotic of choice is not clear but co-amoxiclav should be avoided in women due to increased risk of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis.","The review of 22 trials, involving 6872 women and their babies, found that, in the short term, certain antibiotics given to women, when their waters break early, increase the time babies stay in the womb. They reduced infection, but did not save more babies. One antibiotic (co-amoxiclav) increased the number of babies with a rare condition of inflammation of the bowel (necrotising enterocolitis). Although, in the longer term (at seven years of age) antibiotics seem to have little effect on the health of children, the short-term advantages are such that we recommend antibiotics should be given routinely."
CD006991,"Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review. No studies were at low risk of bias. The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics. There were three comparison pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, n = 109), (2) polypectomy versus systemic steroids (two studies, n = 87); (3) ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid (one study, n = 35). All participants also received topical steroids but doses and types were the same between the treatment arms of each study, except for the study using antibiotics. In that study, the medical treatment arm had higher doses than the surgical arm. In two of the studies, the authors failed to report the outcomes of interest. Although there were important differences in the types of treatments and comparisons used in these studies, the results were similar. Primary outcomes: symptom scores and quality of life scores
There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) failed to find a difference in generic health-related quality of life scores. The quality of this evidence is low or very low. Endoscopic scores and other secondary outcomes
Two studies reported endoscopic scores. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a large, significant effect size in the surgical group, with a mean difference (MD) in score of -1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to -1.22, n = 95) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no polyposis, 3 = severe polyposis). In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups (MD 2.3%, 95% CI -17.4% to 12.8%, n = 34). None of the included studies reported recurrence rates. No differences were found for any objective measurements or olfactory tests in those studies in which they were measured. Complications
Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but rates of up to 21% for medical treatment and 14.3% for surgical treatment are described. Epistaxis was the most commonly reported complication with both medical and surgical treatments, with severe complications reported rarely. The evidence relating to the effectiveness of different types of surgery versus medical treatment for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is of very low quality. The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. The one positive finding from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. As the overall evidence is of very low quality (serious methodological limitations, reporting bias, indirectness and imprecision) and insufficient to draw firm conclusions, further research to investigate this problem, which has significant implications for quality of life and healthcare service usage, is justified.","Four randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 231 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, are included in this review. The number of patients in each study ranged from 34 to 109. The studies took place in ENT departments in several European countries. All patients were adults and most of the studies enrolled more men than women. In all studies the patients were randomly assigned to either surgery or medical treatment (such as antibiotics or steroid tablets or injections) in addition to topical steroids given as nasal sprays or drops. Both the type of surgery performed and the medical treatments used varied widely between the studies, and did not allow all of the studies to be looked at together. Rather, we considered the treatment groups in the four studies as three separate pairs of comparisons instead of simply 'surgical' versus 'medical' treatments. The main outcome measures were patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores and health-related quality of life scores, as well as generic health-related quality of life scores. There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) did not find a difference in general health-related quality of life scores. Two studies reported changes in polyp size (when looked at with an endoscope) using a score. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a significantly better score in the surgery group than in the steroids group at 12 months. In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups. There were no reported differences between the different medical and surgical treatment groups in any study for any other objective (clinician-based) measurements. Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but nosebleeds (epistaxis) were the most commonly described complication with both medical and surgical treatment; severe complications were reported rarely in either group. The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. One positive finding (polyps size scores) from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. There is not enough evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the most appropriate treatment for this condition. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has significant implications for quality of life and the use of healthcare services. Further research to investigate this problem is justified. Overall, we found this evidence to be of low or very low quality. We have low confidence in the estimates of these studies; further research will very likely change these estimates. There were serious limitations in how the studies were carried out or reported (or both), and the number of participants involved was small. In addition, some of the treatment regimens used in the trials are no longer current standards of therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. This evidence is up to date to 20 February 2014."
CD009238,"We found five reports of two single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies (130 participants). Participants in both studies were a mix of adults with either intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis. Both studies had a low risk of bias. One study, with 12 weeks’ follow-up, used a single percutaneous application of 10 Necator americanus (i.e. human hookworm) larvae. The other study, with 24 weeks’ follow-up, used three-weekly oral dosing with 2500 Trichuris suis (i.e. pig whipworm) eggs in aqueous suspension. Of 17 outcomes evaluated in this review, eight were positive (i.e. favoured helminths). Participants taking helminths had no reduction in allergic rhinitis symptoms, percentage of well days (i.e. days with minimal symptoms and no use of medication for allergic rhinitis), lung function measures and quality of life scores. Total use of medication for allergic rhinitis (eye drops, nasal sprays, tablets) did not change; however, in the helminth group there was a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of days during the grass pollen season when participants needed to take tablets as rescue medication for their allergic rhinitis symptoms (MD –14.0%, 95% CI –26.6 to –1.40); in a typical 60-day pollen season this 14% reduction translates into 19 days when tablets would be needed in the helminth group versus 27 days when tablets would be needed in the placebo group. Participants taking helminths percutaneously (i.e. as hookworm larvae) had local skin itching and redness in the first few days after administration. Participants taking helminths were more likely to report any gastrointestinal adverse event (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.45), moderate or severe abdominal pain (RR 7.67, 95% CI 1.87 to 31.57), moderate or severe flatulence (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.81) and moderate or severe diarrhoea (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.37). There was no difference between the helminth and placebo groups in the incidence of serious adverse events, and in study withdrawals. There is currently insufficient evidence on the efficacy, tolerability and likely costs of helminth therapy to support its use in the routine management of allergic rhinitis. Administered to humans in carefully measured doses, helminths appear to be safe. More preclinical studies should be performed, before larger and extended duration trials of helminths for allergic rhinitis are carried out. Future studies should collect and report comparative data on the costs of helminth therapy versus conventional pharmacotherapy.","We included two well-designed studies with a total of 130 adult participants, each study using a different species of gastrointestinal helminth (human hookworm in one study and pig whipworm in the other) as the intervention. Both studies found no significant efficacy from helminths, although one helminth species (Trichuris suis, the pig whipworm) reduced the need for participants to take tablets as ‘rescue medication’ during the grass pollen season. Adverse events such as abdominal pain and flatulence were commoner in the helminth group, but the two helminths species studied did not cause serious adverse reactions. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of helminths for allergic rhinitis in routine clinical practice. More preclinical studies are needed, before larger and extended duration clinical trials of helminths for allergic rhinitis are performed."
CD002312,"We included in this review a total of 12 RCTs. Ten studies assessed fibrinolytic agents versus placebo (993 participants); one study compared streptokinase with urokinase (50 participants); and one compared alteplase versus urokinase (99 participants). The primary outcomes were death, requirement for surgical intervention, overall treatment failure and serious adverse effects. All studies were in the inpatient setting. Outcomes were measured at varying time points from hospital discharge to three months. Seven trials were at low or unclear risk of bias and two at high risk of bias due to inadequate randomisation and inappropriate study design respectively. We found no evidence of difference in overall mortality with fibrinolytic versus placebo (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 8 studies, 867 participants; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence). We found evidence of a reduction in surgical intervention with fibrinolysis in the same studies (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68; 8 studies, 897 participants; I² = 51%; low certainty of evidence); and overall treatment failure (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.58; 7 studies, 769 participants; I² = 88%; very low certainty of evidence, with evidence of significant heterogeneity). We found no clear evidence of an increase in adverse effects with intrapleural fibrinolysis, although this cannot be excluded (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.57; low certainty of evidence). In a sensitivity analysis, the reduction in referrals for surgery and overall treatment failure with fibrinolysis disappeared when the analysis was confined to studies at low or unclear risk of bias. In a moderate-risk population (baseline 14% risk of death, 20% risk of surgery, 27% risk of treatment failure), intra-pleural fibrinolysis leads to 19 more deaths (36 fewer to 59 more), 115 fewer surgical interventions (150 fewer to 55 fewer) and 214 fewer overall treatment failures (252 fewer to 93 fewer) per 1000 people. A single study of streptokinase versus urokinase found no clear difference between the treatments for requirement for surgery (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.72; 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). A single study of alteplase versus urokinase showed no clear difference in requirement for surgery (OR alteplase versus urokinase 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.24) but an increased rate of adverse effects, primarily bleeding, with alteplase (OR 5.61, 95% CI 1.16 to 27.11; 99 participants; low-certainty evidence). This translated into 154 (6 to 499 more) serious adverse events with alteplase compared with urokinase per 1000 people treated. In patients with complicated infective pleural effusion or empyema, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy was associated with a reduction in the requirement for surgical intervention and overall treatment failure but with no evidence of change in mortality. Discordance between the negative largest trial of this therapy and other studies is of concern, however, as is an absence of significant effect when analysing low risk of bias trials only. The reasons for this difference are uncertain but may include publication bias. Intrapleural fibrinolytics may increase the rate of serious adverse events, but the evidence is insufficient to confirm or exclude this possibility.",We searched for studies up to August 2019. We included 10 studies with a total of 993 patients comparing fibrinolytics with a placebo and compared these to look for differences. We also included two studies comparing different fibrinolytics with a total of 149 patients and compared these separately. We found some low-certainty evidence that fibrinolytics moderately reduced the need for surgery. There was no clear evidence that fibrinolytics changed the risk of death. There was some low-certainty evidence which showed that there may be a risk of more side effects (mostly bleeding) with fibrinolytics but this is uncertain. We found no clear evidence that any single fibrinolytic was better than another. We considered the certainty of the evidence identified comparing fibrinolytic with placebo to vary from moderate (risk of death) to very low (overall treatment failure). This was mostly due to some studies having one or more domains at high risk of bias as well as concerns that not all studies of this treatment appear to have been published. We considered the evidence comparing individual fibrinolytics to be of low certainty due to not enough patients in the studies as well as one study being at a high risk of bias.
CD011008,"We included 26 studies with 526 participants. We assessed the studies as being at high or unclear risk of bias overall. We only included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), although the description of randomisation was incomplete in some included studies. We aimed to include double blind RCTs, but two studies were only single blinded. There was inconsistency in the reporting of outcome measures. We analysed the data using a fixed-effect model, and for some outcomes heterogeneity was high. There was a risk of imprecise results due to the low numbers of participants in the included studies. For these reasons we downgraded the quality of the evidence from high to either low or very low. For the primary outcome of breathlessness, the standardised mean post-treatment dyspnoea score was 0.32 points better in the opioid group compared to the placebo group (ranging from a 0.53 point reduction to a 0.10 point reduction) (12 RCTs, 338 participants, low quality evidence). The standardised mean change from baseline dyspnoea score was 0.11 points better in the opioids group compared to the placebo group (ranging from a 0.40 point reduction to a 0.19 increase) (six RCTs, 194 participants, very low quality evidence). A lower score indicates an improvement in breathlessness. The evidence for the six-minute walk test (6MWT) was conflicting. The total distance in 6MWT was 28 metres (m) better in the opioids group compared to placebo (ranging from 113 m to 58 m) (one RCT, 11 participants, very low quality evidence). However, the change in baseline was 48 m worse in the opioids group (ranging from 36 m to 60 m) (two RCTs, 26 participants, very low quality evidence). The adverse effects reported included drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, and constipation. In those studies, participants were 4.73 times more likely to experience nausea and vomiting compared to placebo, three times more likely to experience constipation, and 2.86 times more likely to experience drowsiness (nine studies, 162 participants, very low quality evidence). Only four studies assessed quality of life, and none demonstrated any significant change. There is some low quality evidence that shows benefit for the use of oral or parenteral opioids to palliate breathlessness, although the number of included participants was small. We found no evidence to support the use of nebulised opioids. Further research with larger numbers of participants, using standardised protocols and with quality of life measures included, is needed.","We searched for studies up to 19 October 2015, and we included 26 studies with 526 people. These people had breathlessness from different types of lung disease. Some were given opioid drugs and some were given other drugs or a placebo, and studies compared the reporting of breathlessness to see if there was any difference. Some studies also looked at the amount of time people could exercise to see if there were any differences. Some people came from home, and some came from the hospital setting. There was some low quality evidence that showed a benefit of using oral or injectable opioid drugs for the treatment of the symptoms of breathlessness. There was no evidence for opioids by nebuliser. Some people experienced drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. More research is needed using more people, and looking at effects on quality of life. We rated the quality of the evidence using one of the following grades: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means we are uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means we are very certain about the results. For this Cochrane review, we found that the evidence was of low to very low quality. We included randomised controlled trials which were blinded, which means that participants and those people that assessed the results did not know whether the participants had received the opioid drug or a placebo. However, the trials were of small size, and some studies did not give enough information to allow us to assess whether they were of good quality."
CD008224,"Nine randomized controlled trials involving the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients having urodynamic studies were identified and these included 973 patients in total; one study was an abstract. Two further trials were excluded from the review. The methods of the included trials were poorly described. The primary outcome in all trials was the rate of developing significant bacteriuria, defined as the presence of more than 100,000 bacteria per millilitre of a mid-stream urine sample on culture and sensitivity testing. The other outcomes included pyrexia, haematuria, dysuria and adverse reactions to antibiotics. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics when compared to a placebo reduced the risk of significant bacteriuria (4% with antibiotics versus 12% without, risk ratio (RR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.56) in both men and women. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics also reduced the risk of haematuria (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (40/201, 20% versus 59/214, 28%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03); or in the risk of fever (RR 5.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 28.16) or dysuria (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.36). Only two of 135 people had an adverse reaction to the antibiotics. The number of patients needed to treat with antibiotics to prevent bacteriuria was 12.3. Amongst women, the number needed to treat to prevent bacteriuria was 13.4; while amongst men it was 9.1 (number needed to treat = 1/ absolute risk reduction). Prophylactic antibiotics did reduce the risk of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this effect reduced symptomatic urinary tract infections. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of fever, dysuria or adverse reactions. Potential benefits have to be weighed against clinical and financial implications, and the risk of adverse effects.","We identified nine trials including 973 people. We found that people were less likely to have bacteria in their urine after urodynamic studies if they had antibiotics (4% versus 12%). While they did have fewer urinary tract infections (20% compared with 28% with no antibiotics), this did not reach statistical significance. There were too few adverse effects, such as fever, pain when passing urine or a reaction to the antibiotics, for the findings to be reliable. However, people were less likely to have blood in their urine with antibiotics. There was no information about other treatments which might help reduce infections, nor about different doses or types of antibiotics."
CD010501,"Of the 12 records retrieved by the search, three trials published in 2001, 2003 and 2007, involving 80 inpatients with schizophrenia, aged 18 to 71 years, admitted in a psychiatric facility and followed up for a period nine weeks to 26 weeks, were included. Overall, pyridoxal 5 phosphate produced a significant improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms when compared with placebo, assessed by a change in Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS) scores from baseline to the end of the first phase of the included studies (2 RCTs n = 65, RR 19.97, CI 2.87 to 139.19, low quality evidence). The endpoint tardive dyskinesia score (a measure of its severity) assessed with the ESRS, was significantly lower among participants on pyridoxal 5 phosphate compared to those on placebo (2 RCTs n = 60, MD -4.07, CI -6.36 to -1.79, low quality evidence). It was unclear whether pyridoxal 5 phosphate led to more side effects (n = 65, 2 RCTs, RR 3.97, CI 0.20 to 78.59, low quality evidence) or caused deterioration in tardive dyskinesia symptoms when compared to placebo (n = 65, 2 RCTs, RR 0.16, CI 0.01 to 3.14, low quality evidence). Five participants taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate withdrew from the study because they were not willing to take more medications while none of the participants taking placebo discontinued their medications (n = 65, 2 RCTs, RR 8.72, CI 0.51 to 149.75, low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the endpoint positive and negative psychiatric symptoms scores, measured using the Positive and Negative symptoms Scale (PANSS) between participants taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate and those taking placebo. For the positive symptoms: (n = 15, 1 RCT, MD -1.50, CI -4.80 to 1.80, low quality evidence). For negative the symptoms: (n = 15, 1 RCT, MD -1.10, CI -5.92 to 3.72, low quality evidence). Pyridoxal 5 phosphate may have some benefits in reducing the severity of tardive dyskinesia symptoms among individuals with schizophrenia. However, the quality of evidence supporting the effectiveness of pyridoxal 5 phosphate in treating tardive dyskinesia is low, based on few studies, short follow-up periods, small sample sizes and inadequate adherence to standardised reporting guidelines for randomised controlled trials among the included studies.",". A search for relevant randomised studies was conducted in January 2013. The review includes three studies with 80 participants. All participants had tardive dyskinesia as a result of taking antipsychotic medication and were randomised into treatment groups. One group received pyridoxal 5 phosphate, the other group received a placebo. Antipsychotic treatment continued as usual throughout the trials. . People taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate in these studies experienced more than 40% improvement in their tardive dyskinesia compared to those on placebo, so had less severe tardive dyskinesia. Experience of side effects were similar between treatment groups with participants taking pyridoxal 5 phosphate experiencing no more or less side effects than participants in the placebo group and they did not experience greater worsening of their psychiatric symptoms than those on placebo. Evidence from the studies is weak, but suggests pyridoxal 5 phosphate may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. . Evidence is weak. The number of studies and participants is few. The quality of studies is low. Better evidence could be gathered by better designed, conducted and reported trials. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation. http://mcpin.org/."
CD013124,"We included three studies involving 1879 participants: two RCTs and one cluster-RCT. Interventions consisted of:
· patient workshop and individual coaching using behaviour change techniques;
· individual patient coaching utilising cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing; and
· holistic patient review, multi-disciplinary practitioner training, and organisational change. No studies reported the primary outcome ‘patient involvement in decision-making’ or the primary adverse outcome ‘less patient involvement as a result of the intervention’. Comparing interventions (patient workshop and individual coaching, holistic patient review plus practitioner training, and organisational change) to usual care: we are uncertain whether interventions had any effect on patient reports of high self-rated health (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 5.49; very low-certainty evidence) or on patient enablement (mean difference (MD) 0.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 10.43; very low-certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Interventions probably had no effect on health-related quality of life (adjusted difference in means 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) or on medication adherence (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.17; moderate-certainty evidence) but probably improved the number of patients discussing their priorities (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.38; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably increased the number of nurse consultations (incident rate ratio from adjusted multi-level Poisson model 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.61; moderate-certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect rates of participant death or anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admission compared with usual care. Comparing interventions (patient workshop and coaching, individual patient coaching) to attention-control conditions: we are uncertain whether interventions affect patient-reported high self-rated health (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.00, favouring attention control, with very low-certainty evidence; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.52, favouring the intervention, with very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether interventions affect patient enablement and engagement by increasing either patient activation (MD 1.20, 95% CI -8.21 to 10.61; very low-certainty evidence) or self-efficacy (MD 0.29, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.79; very low-certainty evidence); or whether interventions affect the number of general practice visits (MD 0.51, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.36; very low-certainty evidence), compared to attention-control conditions. The intervention may however lead to more patient-reported changes in management of their health conditions (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44; low-certainty evidence). Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect emergency department attendance nor hospital admission when compared with attention control. Comparing one form of intervention with another: not measured. There was 'unclear' risk across studies for performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias; however, no aspects were 'high' risk. Evidence was downgraded via GRADE, most often because of 'small sample size' and 'evidence from a single study'. Limited available evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of this review. Whilst patient involvement in decision-making is seen as a key mechanism for improving care, it is rarely examined as an intervention and was not measured by included studies. Consistency in design, analysis, and evaluation of interventions would enable a greater likelihood of robust conclusions in future reviews.","We included research published up until August 2018. We found three relevant studies involving 1879 participants. These studies were reported from three countries. Participants were over 65 years of age with three or more long-term health problems on average. Interventions investigated included:
· patient workshops and individual patient coaching;
· patient coaching including cognitive-behavioural therapy; and
· whole-person patient review, practitioner training, and organisational changes. All studies were funded by national research bodies. None of the studies reported the main outcome ‘patient involvement in decision-making about their health care’ nor whether there was less patient involvement as a result of the intervention. Interventions were not found to increase adverse outcomes such as death, anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admissions..
We are uncertain whether interventions for involving older people with more than one long-term health problem in decision-making about their health care can improve their self-rated health or healthcare engagement, or make any difference in self-efficacy (one's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations) or in the overall number of general practice visits. We can report that these interventions probably make little or no difference in patients' quality of life but probably increase the number of patients discussing their priorities, and are associated with more patient consultations with nurses, when compared to usual care. Interventions may be associated with more changes in the management of health conditions when considered from the patient’s perspective when compared with a control group. The quality of the evidence was limited by small studies, and by studies choosing to measure different outcomes, resulting in lack of data that could be combined in analyses. Further research in this developing area is required before firm conclusions can be drawn."
CD007720,"We included 17 RCTs comprising a total of 2264 participants; 13 RCTs included 1954 adult participants, and four RCTs included 310 children. This update included 12 new studies, excluded one previously included study, and excluded five new trials. One trial awaits classification. All trials limited inclusion to inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). We assessed the risk of selection bias and attrition bias as low or unclear overall. We assessed performance bias risk as low for nine trials, unclear for one trial, and high for seven trials. We assessed reporting bias risk as low for three trials and high for the remaining 14 trials. Corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality in adults with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; moderate-quality evidence), but not in adults with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Early clinical failure rates (defined as death from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical instability at day 5 to 8) were significantly reduced with corticosteroids in people with severe and non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83, respectively; high-quality evidence). Corstocosteroids reduced time to clinical cure, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, development of respiratory failure or shock not present at pneumonia onset, and rates of pneumonia complications. Among children with bacterial pneumonia, corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (defined as for adults, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. Hyperglycaemia was significantly more common in adults treated with corticosteroids (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There were no significant differences between corticosteroid-treated people and controls for other adverse events or secondary infections (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.93). Corticosteroid therapy reduced mortality and morbidity in adults with severe CAP; the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49) to prevent one death. Corticosteroid therapy reduced morbidity, but not mortality, for adults and children with non-severe CAP. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, especially hyperglycaemia, but the harms did not seem to outweigh the benefits.","We included 17 studies evaluating systemic corticosteroid therapy (given intravenously or by tablets) for people with pneumonia (2264 participants; 1954 adults and 310 children). We included 12 new studies in this update and excluded one previously included study. All included studies evaluated people who had acquired pneumonia in the community (community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)) being treated in the hospital; no studies assessed people who had developed pneumonia while in hospital or who were on breathing machines (mechanically ventilated). Eight trials did not report funding sources; seven were funded by academic sponsors; one was funded by a pharmaceutical company; and one reported receiving no funding. Corticosteroids reduced deaths in adults with severe CAP, but not in people with non-severe CAP. Eighteen adults with severe CAP need to be treated with corticosteroids to prevent one death. People with CAP treated with corticosteroids had lower clinical failure rates (death, worsening of imaging studies, or no clinical improvement), shorter time to cure, a shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications. We found good-quality evidence that corticosteroids reduced clinical failure rates in children with pneumonia, but the data were based on a small number of children with different types of pneumonia. People treated with corticosteroids had higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) than those not treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroid treatment was not associated with increased rates of other serious adverse events. Corticosteroids were beneficial for adults with severe CAP. People with non-severe CAP may also benefit from corticosteroid therapy, but with no survival advantage. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to issues with study design, unclear results, or results that were not similar across studies. For the outcomes of death and clinical failure in adults, we graded the quality of the evidence as moderate. For the outcomes of clinical failure in people with severe CAP, non-severe CAP, and in children, we graded the quality of the evidence as high."
CD011107,"We included 20 studies with 1401 surgical participants comparing an α-2 agonist against a control. Thirteen studies compared clonidine with a control, whilst seven compared dexmedetomidine with a control. The doses, methods, and time of administration varied between studies: three studies gave the drug orally or as an intravenous bolus preoperatively and nine intraoperatively; one study gave the drug as an infusion starting preoperatively and seven started at varying points from anaesthetic induction to the end of surgery. Whilst all the studies were described as randomized, many provided insufficient detail on methods used. We had anticipated that attempts would be made to reduce performance bias by blinding of personnel and participants, however this was detailed in only six of the papers. Similarly, in some studies detail was lacking on methods to reduce the risk of detection bias. We therefore downgraded the quality of evidence in our 'Summary of findings' table by one level for risk of bias using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. All 20 included studies presented outcome data for postoperative shivering, and in meta-analysis α-2 agonists were shown to significantly reduce the risk of shivering (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.43, P value < 0.0001). We found significant evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 80%) for this result that was not explained by sensitivity or subgroup analysis; we therefore downgraded the inconsistency of the evidence by one level. Although we did not feel that there were concerns with imprecision or indirectness of the data, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for the risk of publication bias following visual analysis of a funnel plot. Using GRADEpro, we rated the overall quality of the data for shivering as very low. Only one study reported the incidence of core hypothermia, whilst 12 studies measured core temperature. However, as the results for core temperature were reported in different styles, pooling the results was inappropriate. We found no studies with participant-reported outcomes such as experience of shivering or participant satisfaction. We found limited data for the outcomes of length of stay in the postanaesthetic care unit (three studies, 200 participants) and the following adverse effects: sedation (nine studies, 875 participants), bradycardia (eight studies, 716 participants), and hypotension (seven studies, 688 participants). Unpooled analysis suggested that sedation and bradycardia were significantly more common with dexmedetomidine than placebo, with all seven dexmedetomidine studies and none of the clonidine studies reporting statistically significantly higher levels of sedation as an adverse effect. There is evidence that clonidine and dexmedetomidine can reduce postoperative shivering, but patients given dexmedetomidine may be more sedated. However, our assessment of the quality of this evidence is very low.","The evidence is current up to 13 June 2014. We found 20 relevant randomized controlled trials with 1401 participants undergoing surgical procedures with general anaesthesia. These studies compared an α-2 agonist (either clonidine or dexmedetomidine) with a control. The doses, methods, and time that the drugs were given varied between studies. All studies reported results for shivering. Our analysis showed that α-2 agonists significantly reduce the risk of postoperative shivering when administered before or during surgery. However, our analysis also showed that there were significant differences between studies that we could not explain. Some study authors had also presented results for core temperature, length of stay in the recovery room, and clinical side effects of the drugs. Seven studies reported that participants given dexmedetomidine were more likely to have a higher level of sedation after surgery, and five studies reported that participants given dexmedetomidine were more likely to have bradycardia (slower heart rate). We did not combine these results in an analysis. None of the studies presented patient-reported outcomes. We felt that the quality of the evidence was low and that some authors did not make enough of an effort to reduce the risk of bias in the methods, which could affect their results. For example, not all authors masked the anaesthetist or surgeon to which drug was given to each participant. This, along with some unexplained differences between studies and some concern about whether we could have missed some relevant results that had not been published, led us to assess the quality of the evidence for shivering as very low. We used GRADEpro software to assess evidence quality. Alpha-2 agonists may reduce the number of people who shiver after surgical procedures, but they are likely to make people sleepier as a side effect. However, the evidence is from studies of very low quality."
CD006815,"The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.","This review shows that hydroxyzine is better than placebo in terms of anxiety symptoms in individuals with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Too few data were available to be able to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and tolerability of hydroxyzine compared with benzodiazepines and buspirone. Given the robust evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants for GAD, these findings suggest that hydroxyzine should not be recommended as first-line treatment GAD."
CD001191,"A total of 13 trials met the inclusion criteria of the review. The trials had a duration of between 12 and 52 weeks. The older trials tested a capsule form with a dose of up to 12 mg/day. Trials reported since 2007 have tested continuous dose transdermal patch formulations delivering 4.6, 9.5 and 17.7 mg/day. Our main analysis compared the safety and efficacy of rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally with placebo. Seven trials contributed data from 3450 patients to this analysis. Data from another two studies were not included because of a lack of information and methodological concerns. All the included trials were multicentre trials and recruited patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with a mean age of about 75 years. All had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation but the risk of bias due to attrition was unclear in four studies, low in one study and high in two studies. After 26 weeks of treatment rivastigmine compared to placebo was associated with better outcomes for cognitive function measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) score (mean difference (MD) -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.21 to -1.37, n = 3232, 6 studies) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.97, n = 3205, 6 studies), activities of daily living (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27, n = 3230, 6 studies) and clinician rated global impression of changes, with a smaller proportion of patients treated with rivastigmine experiencing no change or a deterioration (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.80, n = 3338, 7 studies). Three studies reported behavioural change, and there were no differences compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.06, n = 1529, 3 studies). Only one study measured the impact on caregivers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) scale and this found no difference between the groups (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.91 to 1.11, n = 529, 1 study). Overall, participants who received rivastigmine were about twice as likely to withdraw from the trials (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.37, n = 3569, 7 studies) or to experience an adverse event during the trials (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.57, n = 3587, 7 studies). Rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily orally or 9.5 mg daily transdermally) appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, better outcomes were observed for rate of decline of cognitive function and activities of daily living, although the effects were small and of uncertain clinical importance. There was also a benefit from rivastigmine on the outcome of clinician's global assessment. There were no differences between the rivastigmine group and placebo group in behavioural change or impact on carers. At these doses the transdermal patch may have fewer side effects than the capsules but has comparable efficacy. The quality of evidence is only moderate for all of the outcomes reviewed because of a risk of bias due to dropouts. All the studies with usable data were industry funded or sponsored. This review has not examined economic data.","This review included double-blinded randomised controlled trials, and the evidence was searched for up to March 2015 using the standard Cochrane methods. The review included studies conducted for at least 12 weeks that compared the safety and effectiveness of rivastigmine compared with placebo. Thirteen studies that met these criteria were found. Most of these studies involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with an average age of around 75 years. Results from seven trials showed that patients on rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg/day by mouth, or 9.5 mg/day by skin patch) were better for three outcomes than those on placebo, after six months of treatment. The differences were quite small for cognitive function (2 points, using the ADAS-Cog which has a range of 70 points) and activities of daily living (standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.20, which is considered a small effect). Patients on rivastigmine were more likely to show overall improvement compared with those on placebo (odds ratio of 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.25 to 1.72) . However, there was no difference for behavioural changes (reported by three trials) or impact on carers (reported by one trial). Patients on rivastigmine were also about twice as likely to experience adverse events, although this risk might have been slightly less for patients using patches compared with capsules. It was possible that certain types of adverse events were less in people using patches than taking capsules (nausea, vomiting, weight loss, dizziness). In summary, rivastigmine may be of benefit to people with Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that the using a patch is associated with reduced side effects compared to using oral capsules. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes reviewed was moderate. The main factors affecting our confidence in the results included relatively high number of patients dropping out in some of the trials (the rates of dropout in the rivastigmine arms were higher). There were also concerns about the applicability of the evidence for the long term treatment of Alzheimer's disease since data from double-blinded randomised controlled trials were only available for up to 12 months. All the data included in the main analysis of this review came from studies either sponsored or funded by the drug manufacturer (Novartis Pharma)."
CD007641,"Four trials (involving a total of 269 participants) were included. The participants were children with cystic fibrosis and their parents or caregivers in three trials and adults with cystic fibrosis in one trial. The trials compared four different self-management education interventions versus standard treatment: (1) a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis in general; (2) education specific to aerosol and airway clearance treatments; (3) disease-specific nutrition education; and (4) general and disease-specific nutrition education. Training children to manage cystic fibrosis in general had no statistically significant effects on weight after six to eight weeks, mean difference -7.74 lb (i.e. 3.51 kg) (95% confidence interval -35.18 to 19.70). General and disease-specific nutrition education for adults had no statistically significant effects on: pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume at one second), mean difference -5.00 % (95% confidence interval -18.10 to 8.10) at six months and mean difference -5.50 % (95% confidence interval -18.46 to 7.46) at 12 months; or weight, mean difference - 0.70 kg (95% confidence interval -6.58 to 5.18) at six months and mean difference -0.70 kg (95% confidence interval -6.62 to 5.22) at 12 months; or dietary fat intake scores, mean difference 1.60 (85% confidence interval -2.90 to 6.10) at six months and mean difference 0.20 (95% confidence interval -4.08 to 4.48) at 12 months. There is some limited evidence to suggest that self-management education may improve knowledge in patients with cystic fibrosis but not in parents or caregivers. There is also some limited evidence to suggest that self-management education may result in positively changing a small number of behaviours in both patients and caregivers. The available evidence from this review is of insufficient quantity and quality to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of self-management education for cystic fibrosis. Further trials are needed to investigate the effects of self-management education on a range of clinical and behavioural outcomes in children, adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.","We set out to review the effects of self-management education for cystic fibrosis on a range of health outcomes in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers. Our search for available evidence identified four trials, and all four compared a form of self-management education to standard treatment. The precise focus of self management differed between trials and included a training programme for managing cystic fibrosis, education on chest treatments, education on nutrition specific to cystic fibrosis, and education on general and disease-specific nutrition. Self-management education had no positive effects on lung function, weight, or intake of fatty food. There is some evidence to suggest that self-management education improves knowledge about cystic fibrosis and its management in patients with this condition and some self-management behaviours in patients and caregivers. However, due to the small number of trials in this review, and because of concerns about the quality of these trials, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions about the effects of self-management education for cystic fibrosis. We recommend that further trials are conducted to evaluate the effects of self-management education interventions."
CD007795,"One trial, which involved 38,546 subjects and compared vaccination with placebo, met our inclusion criteria. This included study was of high quality. However, its participants were all aged 60 years or more and most of them were white, which may mean that its findings are not applicable to all populations. The vaccine was effective in decreasing the incidence of herpes zoster, but there was no evidence that it had efficacy in reducing the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia beyond its effect on the incidence of herpes zoster. Adverse events at the injection site were more common among vaccine recipients than placebo recipients, but they were mild and resolved in a few days. Serious adverse events were rare. There is insufficient direct evidence from specialised trials to prove the efficacy of vaccine for preventing postherpetic neuralgia beyond its effect on reducing herpes zoster, although vaccination may be efficacious and safe for preventing herpes zoster and thus reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia in adults aged 60 years or older.","We identified a single high quality trial with a total of 38,546 participants, comparing vaccination with placebo. It found a significant reduction of herpes zoster, but did not provide enough direct evidence to draw any conclusion about whether the vaccine is effective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia beyond its effect on reducing herpes zoster. Non-serious adverse events were more common among vaccine recipients than placebo recipients, but serious ones were rare. More well designed and specialised trials of vaccination for preventing postherpetic neuralgia are required."
CD006425,"This review update includes 24 studies (10,056 women). Twenty studies (9789 women) contribute data to analyses. Most studies took place in high-income countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Australia. In the first five comparisons, we display the included trials according to type of intervention without pooling data. For the 'Summary of findings' we pooled data for a summary effect. Five included studies were cluster-randomised trials: all of these adjusted data and reported adjustments as odds ratios (OR). We have analysed the data using the generic inverse variance method and presented results as odds ratios, because we were unable to derive a cluster-adjusted risk ratio from the published cluster-trial. We acknowledge that the use of odds ratio prevents the pooling of these cluster trials in our main analyses. One method of BF education with standard (routine) care
There were no group differences for duration of any BF in days or weeks. There was no evidence that interventions improved the proportion of women with any BF or exclusive BF at three or six months. Single trials of different interventions were unable to show that education improved initiation of BF, apart from one small trial at high risk of attrition bias. Many trial results marginally favoured the intervention but had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. BF complications such as mastitis and other BF problems were similar in treatment arms in single trials reporting these outcomes. Multiple methods of BF education versus standard care
For all trials included in this comparison we have presented the cluster-adjusted odds ratios as reported in trial publications. One three-arm study found the intervention of BF booklet plus video plus Lactation Consultant versus standard care improved the proportion of women exclusively BF at three months (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.40; women = 159) and marginally at six months (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.76; women = 175). For the same trial, an intervention arm without a lactation consultant but with the BF booklet and video did not have the same effect on proportion of women exclusively BF at three months (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.05; women = 159) or six months (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.70; women = 184). One study compared monthly BF sessions and weekly cell phone message versus standard care and reported improvements in the proportion of women exclusively BF at both three and six months (three months OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.95; women = 390; six months OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.11; women = 390). One study found monthly BF sessions and weekly cell phone messages improved initiation of BF over standard care (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.24; women = 380). BF education session versus standard care, pooled analyses for 'Summary of findings' (SoF)
This comparison does not include cluster-randomised trials reporting adjusted odds ratios. We did not downgrade any evidence for trials' lack of blinding; no trial had adequate blinding of staff and participants. The SoF table presents risk ratios for all outcomes analysed. For proportion of women exclusively BF there is no evidence that antenatal BF education improved BF at three months (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; women = 822; studies = 3; moderate quality evidence) or at six months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; women = 2161; studies = 4; moderate quality evidence). For proportion of women with any BF there were no group differences in BF at three (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; women = 654; studies = 2; I² = 60%; low-quality evidence) or six months (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23; women = 1636; studies = 4; I² = 61%; high-quality evidence). There was no evidence that antenatal BF education could improve initiation of BF (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09; women = 3505; studies = 8; I² = 69%; high-quality evidence). Where we downgraded evidence this was due to small sample size or wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, or both. There was insufficient data for subgroup analysis of mother's occupation or education. There was no conclusive evidence supporting any antenatal BF education for improving initiation of BF, proportion of women giving any BF or exclusively BF at three or six months or the duration of BF. There is an urgent need to conduct a high-quality, randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of antenatal BF education, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Evidence in this review is primarily relevant to high-income settings.","We included 24 studies with 10,056 women in the review, and 20 studies involving 9789 women contributed data to the analyses. Most studies took place in high-income countries including the USA, Canada, UK and Australia. Peer counselling, lactation consultation and formal BF education during pregnancy do not appear to improve uptake of BF or duration. However, some larger trials in different settings (one in Nigeria and one in Singapore) had some evidence that education may help. We are still unsure if antenatal BF education is able to help women; at present, there is no good evidence from randomised controlled trials to suggest these efforts to educate pregnant women translate into more and longer BF. Women who receive standard care before birth tend to choose BF at about the same rate as women who have extra BF education. We are confident in the results of studies measuring women's uptake of BF at birth and BF at six months; education does not appear to impact these decisions. We have some doubts about the impact of education on exclusive BF at three and six months; education does not seem to help women, but future studies may change our understanding. Future studies are likely to change our understanding of the impact of BF education during pregnancy on BF at three months. Most of the studies in this review took place in higher income countries, so we are not confident that our conclusions are relevant in other settings."
CD008122,"We identified 74 unique studies as eligible for this review and categorized them according to the antigens they detected. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (fromP. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens. Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens. In comparisons with microscopy, we identified 71 evaluations of Type 1 tests, eight evaluations of Type 2 tests and five evaluations of Type 3 tests. In meta-analyses, average sensitivities and specificities (95% CI) were 94.8% (93.1% to 96.1%) and 95.2% (93.2% to 96.7%) for Type 1 tests, 96.0% (94.0% to 97.3%) and 95.3% (87.3% to 98.3%) for Type 2 tests, and 99.5% (71.0% to 100.0%) and 90.6% (80.5% to 95.7%) for Type 3 tests, respectively. Overall for HRP-2, the meta-analytical average sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 95.0% (93.5% to 96.2%) and 95.2% (93.4% to 99.4%), respectively. For pLDH antibody-based RDTs verified with microscopy, we identified 17 evaluations of Type 4 RDTs and three evaluations of Type 5 RDTs. In meta-analyses, average sensitivity for Type 4 tests was 91.5% (84.7% to 95.3%) and average specificity was 98.7% (96.9% to 99.5%). For Type 5 tests, average sensitivity was 98.4% (95.1% to 99.5%) and average specificity was 97.5% (93.5% to 99.1%). Overall for pLDH, the meta-analytical average sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 93.2% (88.0% to 96.2%) and 98.5% (96.7% to 99.4%), respectively. For both categories of test, there was substantial heterogeneity in study results. Quality of the microscopy reference standard could only be assessed in 40% of studies due to inadequate reporting, but results did not seem to be influenced by the reporting quality. Overall, HRP-2 antibody-based tests (such as the Type 1 tests) tended to be more sensitive and were significantly less specific than pLDH-based tests (such as the Type 4 tests). If the point estimates for Type 1 and Type 4 tests are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients where 30% of those presenting with symptoms have P. falciparum, Type 1 tests will miss 16 cases, and Type 4 tests will miss 26 cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with P. falciparum would be 34 with Type 1 tests, and nine with Type 4 tests. The sensitivity and specificity of all RDTs is such that they can replace or extend the access of diagnostic services for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. HRP-2 antibody types may be more sensitive but are less specific than pLDH antibody-based tests, but the differences are small. The HRP-2 antigen persists even after effective treatment and so is not useful for detecting treatment failures.","Standard diagnosis of malaria in the past has depended on blood microscopy, but this requires a technician and a laboratory, and is often not feasible for basic health services in many areas. Sometimes in research studies, another technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used, but again this requires equipment and trained staff, and cannot be used routinely. Technological advances have led to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. These detect parasite-specific antigens in the blood, are simple to use, and can give results as a simple positive or negative result, within 15 minutes. This review evaluates the accuracy of RDTs compared with microscopy and PCR for detecting Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the blood. It includes 74 studies, giving a total of 111 RDT evaluations (of which 104 compared RDTs with microscopy), reporting a total of 60,396 RDT results. Results are presented by type of test, classified by the malaria antigen that they are designed to detect (either histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), or plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)). The results indicate that RDTs can be very accurate compared to microscopy and PCR. The performance of RDT types varied but the differences were not large. HRP-2-based tests tended to be more sensitive (ie they identified more true cases of malaria) and less specific (ie they wrongly identified more malaria that was not present) than pLDH-based tests. Choice will depend on prevalence of malaria, and we provide data in this review to assist these decisions, although policy makers will also take into account other factors relating to cost and test stability."
CD003323,"Six heterogeneous trials were identified with 442 participants. Methodological flaws of the included trials included incomplete follow-up and inadequate reporting of outcomes. Three trials compared ACI versus mosaicplasty. One reported statistically significant results in favour of ACI at one year in the numbers of people with 'good' or 'excellent' functional results. Conversely, another trial found significant improvement for the mosaicplasty group when assessed using one functional scoring system at two years, but no statistically significant differences based on two other scoring systems. A third trial found no difference between ACI and mosaicplasty, 10 months on average after the surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcomes at two years in a single trial comparing ACI with microfracture nor in the functional results at 18 months of a single trial comparing characterised chondrocyte implantation versus microfracture. However, the results at 36 months for this trial seemed to indicate better functional results for characterised chondrocyte implantation compared with those for microfracture. The sixth trial comparing matrix-guided ACI versus microfracture found significantly better results for functional outcomes at two year follow-up in the MACI group. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the use of ACI for treating full thickness articular cartilage defects in the knee. Further good quality randomised controlled trials with long-term functional outcomes are required.","This review includes six small randomised controlled trials that compared ACI with either mosaicplasty or microfracture. Although there are some promising results for ACI compared with microfracture from one trial, the evidence from two other trials testing the same comparison did not confirm these. None of the other three trials testing different comparisons provided conclusive evidence in favour of ACI, although the longer-term results suggest that the results for some types of ACI may improve over time. The review identified several ongoing trials that should help to provide evidence to inform on the use of ACI in the future. Meanwhile, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the use of ACI."
CD010208,"We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5-hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT). All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals. Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants). Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias. Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes. Of the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06). The latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias. The one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow-up (MD = -2.42 days, 95% CI -5.03 to 0.19). Finally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis-Work Instability Scale (RA-WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement -4.67 points, 95% CI -8.43 to -0.91). We identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials. This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis. While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.","We searched the available literature up to 30 April 2014. We included three randomised controlled trials with 414 participants who had IA and who were at risk of losing their jobs. These trials first evaluated how the work environment could be adapted and then provided counselling, advice or education for work problems. One trial gave two 1.5-hour sessions over five months. Another trial gave two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months. The third trial gave six to eight individual or group sessions over six months. The included trials compared the effects of interventions to usual care (two trials) or to written information only (one trial). Two of the included trials measured the effect of the intervention on job loss (382 participants) when the third measured effect on work absenteeism and work functioning (32 participants). When considered together, the evidence from the three trials was of very low quality. Two trials found different results on job loss measured at two years' follow-up: one trial on job counselling found a large reduction in people who lost their job and the other trial found similar effects in both groups. Another trial did not find a considerable effect on absenteeism at six months' follow-up but found a moderate improvement in work functioning. Because of positive results from one RCT with long term follow-up, we see potential for job loss prevention interventions in helping workers with inflammatory arthritis to stay at work. The certainty of these results is limited by the very low quality evidence of the three RCTs overall."
CD001556,"We identified a total of 13 randomized trials involving 2362 participants. Ten trials (2122 participants) reported sufficient detail on survival to be included in a meta-analysis for the primary outcome. Preoperative chemotherapy improves overall survival (HR 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.96) and is associated with a significantly higher rate of complete (R0) resection (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19). No evidence suggests that the overall rate of resection (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01), tumor recurrence (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22) or nonfatal complications (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.06) was different for preoperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone. Trials reported risks of toxicity with chemotherapy that ranged from 11% to 90%. In summary, preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery offers a survival advantage compared with surgery alone for patients with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer, but the evidence is of moderate quality. Some evidence of toxicity and preoperative mortality have been associated with chemotherapy.","This review included information from 13 randomized studies and combined results from 2122 patients to answer our question regarding survival. This review of 13 trials, including patients with esophageal cancer of any cell type, found some evidence that cisplatin-based chemotherapy may help them to live longer. However, chemotherapy may introduce side effects. This review used information from randomized studies that is considered to represent the highest quality of evidence."
CD000536,"A total of 14 trials were included in this review; 4970 patient results were analysed. Four trials evaluating vitamin K antagonists (VKA) versus no VKA suggested that oral anticoagulation may favour autologous venous, but not artificial, graft patency as well as limb salvage and survival. Two other studies comparing VKA with aspirin (ASA) or aspirin and dipyridamole provided evidence to support a positive effect of VKA on the patency of venous but not artificial grafts. Three trials comparing low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to unfractionated heparin (UFH) failed to demonstrate a significant difference on patency. One trial comparing LMWH with placebo found no significant improvement in graft patency over the first postoperative year in a population receiving aspirin. One trial showed an advantage for LMWH versus aspirin and dipyridamol at one year for patients undergoing limb salvage procedures. Perioperative administration of ancrod showed no greater benefit when compared to unfractionated heparin. Dextran 70 showed similar graft patency rates to LMWH but a significantly higher proportion of patients developed heart failure with dextran. Patients undergoing infrainguinal venous graft are more likely to benefit from treatment with VKA than platelet inhibitors. Patients receiving an artificial graft benefit from platelet inhibitors (aspirin). However, the evidence is not conclusive. Randomised controlled trials with larger patient numbers are needed in the future to compare antithrombotic therapies with either placebo or antiplatelet therapies.","Surgery to bypass the blockage uses either a piece of vein from another part of the person’s body or a synthetic graft. The bypass may help improve blood supply to the leg but the graft can also become blocked, even in the first year. To help prevent this, people are given aspirin (an antiplatelet drug) or a vitamin K antagonist (anti-blood clotting or antithrombotic drug), or both, to try to stop loss of blood flow through the graft (patency). The review of trials found that patients undergoing venous grafts were more likely to benefit from treatment with vitamin K antagonists than platelet inhibitors. Patients receiving an artificial graft may benefit from platelet inhibitors (aspirin). However, the evidence is not conclusive. Although a total of 14 randomised, controlled trials involving 4970 patients were included in the review, trials with larger patient numbers are needed. This is because there was considerable variation between the included trials in whether patients received both types of drugs, anticoagulation levels and how they were measured, and the indications for surgery, intermittent claudication or critical limb ischaemia."
CD001366,"Twelve studies with 13 comparisons were included. Four studies compared dietitian with doctor, seven with self-help resources, and only one study was found for dietitian versus nurse and dietitian versus counsellor comparisons. Participants receiving advice from dietitians experienced a greater reduction in blood cholesterol than those receiving advice only from doctors (-0.25 mmol/L (95% CI -0.37, -0.12 mmol/L)). There was no statistically significant difference in change in blood cholesterol between dietitians and self-help resources (-0.10 mmol/L (95% CI -0.22, 0.03 mmol/L)). No statistically significant differences were detected for secondary outcome measures between any of the comparisons with the exception of dietitian versus nurse for HDLc, where the dietitian group showed a greater reduction (-0.06 mmol/L (95% CI -0.11, -0.01)) and dietitian versus counsellor for body weight, where the dietitian group showed a greater reduction (-5.80 kg (95% CI -8.91, -2.69 kg)). Dietitians were better than doctors at lowering blood cholesterol in the short to medium term, but there was no evidence that they were better than self-help resources. There was no evidence that dietitians provided better outcomes than nurses. The results should be interpreted with caution as the studies were not of good quality and the analysis was based on a limited number of trials.","This review looked at the effectiveness of dietary advice given by dietitians to lower blood cholesterol, compared with the effectiveness of dietary advice given by other types of health professional or using self-help resources. The review found that advice by dietitians to lower blood cholesterol was more effective than that of doctors (in the short to medium term), but possibly not more effective than using self-help resources. There was no evidence to suggest that dietary advice given by dietitians was more effective than that given by nurses."
CD007421,"We analysed 26 studies with a total of 6704 participants. Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate: the main limitations were imprecision and/or heterogeneity. Compared to embryos transferred in media containing no or low (0.125 mg/mL) HA, the addition of functional (0.5 mg/mL) HA concentrations to the transfer media probably increases the live birth rate (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.31; 10 RCTs, N = 4066; I² = 33%; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no HA addition in media is assumed to be 33%, the chance following HA addition would be between 37% and 44%. The addition of HA may slightly decrease miscarriage rates (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 7 RCTs, N = 3091; I² = 66%; low-quality evidence). Nevertheless, when only studies with low risk of bias were included in the analysis, there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.23; N = 2219; I² = 36%). Adding HA to transfer media probably results in an increase in both clinical pregnancy (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23; 17 studies, N = 5247; I² = 40%; moderate-quality evidence) and multiple pregnancy rates (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.70; 7 studies, N = 3337; I² = 36%; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of HA added to transfer media on the rate of total adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.84; 3 studies, N = 1487; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence shows improved clinical pregnancy and live birth rates with the addition of HA as an adherence compound in embryo transfer media in ART. Low-quality evidence suggests that adding HA may slightly decrease miscarriage rates, but when only studies at low risk of bias were included in the analysis, the results were inconclusive. HA had no clear effect on the rate of total adverse events. The increase in multiple pregnancy rates may be due to combining an adherence compound and transferring more than one embryo. Further studies of adherence compounds with single embryo transfer need to be undertaken.","We found 26 studies including 6704 women aged 27 to 35 years who underwent IVF/ICSI. These studies compared embryo transfer using media containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid versus solutions containing no or low concentrations of hyaluronic acid. We were interested in learning how the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the transfer solution affected the numbers of:
· live births;
· miscarriages (loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks' gestation);
· clinical pregnancies;
· multiple pregnancies; and
· adverse (unwanted) events. Embryo transfer using media with high concentrations of hyaluronic acid probably increases the number of live births compared with using solutions with low concentrations or no hyaluronic acid (10 studies). If transfer media with low concentrations or no hyaluronic acid have a 33% chance of resulting in a live birth, solutions with high concentrations increase the chance of a live birth to between 37% and 44%. There would probably be 1 additional live birth for every 14 embryos transferred in a high-concentration hyaluronic acid solution. High concentrations of hyaluronic acid in the embryo transfer solution probably also increase the number of clinical pregnancies (17 studies) and the number of multiple pregnancies (7 studies). Using transfer solutions containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid may result in slightly fewer miscarriages (7 studies). But our analysis did not show a clear difference if we left out studies whose results varied widely. Reported adverse events included ectopic pregnancies (when an embryo becomes implanted outside the womb) and abnormalities affecting the embryo or the foetus. Similar numbers of adverse events were reported for both types of transfer solution (high and low concentrations of hyaluronic acid): we found no evidence that the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the transfer solution affected the number of adverse events reported. We are moderately confident about our results for the numbers of live births, clinical pregnancies, and multiple pregnancies. Our results may change if further evidence becomes available. We are less confident about the rate of miscarriage and the number of adverse events, because results for these varied widely. Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. Embryo transfer using solutions containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid probably increases the number of live births in IVF/ICSI. Transfer solutions containing high concentrations of hyaluronic acid may slightly decrease the rate of miscarriage."
CD012450,"Thirteen trials (1047 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Nine trials included participants with radicular low back pain, two trial with low back pain, and two trials with spinal stenosis. All trials blinded participants to receipt of systemic corticosteroids. Seven trials were at low risk of bias, five at unclear risk, and one at high risk of selection bias. Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy varied. Radicular low back pain
For radicular low back pain, moderate-certainty evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly decrease pain versus placebo at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.56 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 0.04 on a 0 to 10 scale) and may slightly increase the likelihood of experiencing improvement in pain at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; absolute effect 5% better (95% CI 5% worse to 15% better). Systemic corticosteroids may not improve function at short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.14 better; range 0.49 better to 0.21 worse) and probably increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short-term follow-up (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91; absolute effect 19% better, 95% CI 8% better to 30% better). Systemic corticosteroids were associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo at long-term follow-up (MD −7.40, 95% CI −12.55 to −2.25 on the 0 to 100 Oswestry Disability Index) and greater likelihood of functional improvement (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.56), based on a single trial. There was no difference in likelihood of surgery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47). Evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single dose or as a short course of therapy) are not associated with increased risk of any adverse event, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or hyperglycemia, but estimates were imprecise as some trials did not report harms, and harms reporting was suboptimal in trials that did provide data. Limitations included variability across trials in interventions (e.g. corticosteroid used, dose and duration of treatment), clinical settings, and participants (e.g. duration of symptoms, methods for diagnosis); limited utility of subgroup analyses due to small numbers of trials; methodologic limitations or suboptimal reporting of methods by some trials; and too few trials to formally assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical tests for small sample effects. Non-radicular low back pain
Evidence on systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for non-radicular pain was limited and suggested that systemic corticosteroids may be associated with slightly worse short-term pain but slightly better function. Spinal stenosis
For spinal stenosis, limited evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids are probably no more effective than placebo for short-term pain or function. Systemic corticosteroids appear to be slightly effective at improving short-term pain and function in people with radicular low back pain not due to spinal stenosis, and might slightly improve long-term function. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in people with non-radicular low back pain are unclear and systemic corticosteroids are probably ineffective for spinal stenosis. A single dose or short course of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain does not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited.","We included 13 studies with 1047 people. Six studies were conducted in the US, four in Europe, one in Australia, one in Brazil, and one in Iran. Nine studies evaluated people with radicular low back pain, two studies evaluated people with non-radicular low back pain, and two studies evaluated people with spinal stenosis. In five studies, back pain was of short duration and in the other studies the duration of back pain was longer or mixed. The average age of people in the studies ranged from 36 to 47 years, except for the studies of spinal stenosis, where the average age was about 58 years. Pain scores before treatment were about 6.6 to 9.0 points on a scale of 0 to 10. The dose and length of treatment with systemic corticosteroids or placebo varied across studies. For radicular low back pain, systemic corticosteroids appear to slightly reduce pain in the short term and allow resumption of normal activities, and might slightly improve people's ability to perform normal activities at long-term. Systemic corticosteroids probably do not reduce the likelihood of undergoing surgery to remove a slipped or bulging disc and had no impact on quality of life. For other types of low back pain (non-radicular low back pain or spinal stenosis), the effects of systemic corticosteroids were unclear or suggested no benefit. In the doses given in the studies, systemic corticosteroids for low back pain did not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence was limited. For radicular low back pain, we are moderately confident about effects on short-term pain, short-term function, long-term function (but based on only one study), likelihood of surgery, and short-term quality of life. For spinal stenosis, we are moderately confident only about effects on short-term pain and function. For other time points and outcomes and for non-radicular low back pain, we have little confidence about the evidence. Factors that decreased confidence in findings included flaws in how the studies were designed (patients were not assigned to treatments randomly, a lot of patients dropped out of the study, or there were large differences between patients assigned to different treatments), not having enough studies or participants to be certain about the results, and  variations between studies in results and methods. For people with radicular low back pain, studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy, how effectiveness varies according to symptom duration, and whether imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis of a bulging or slipped disc before using systemic corticosteroids. Studies are also needed to clarify effects of systemic corticosteroids on quality of life, long-term outcomes, and harms. For people with non-radicular low back pain or spinal stenosis, research showing that some people have an inflammatory component would be helpful to determine whether well-designed clinical trials should be conducted, and which people should be included in them. The evidence is current to September 2021."
CD005008,"We identified 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion durations (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak doses (5280 participants). Seven studies were RCTs addressing different anthracycline infusion durations; we identified long-term follow-up data for one of the trials in this update. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of six hours or longer as compared to a shorter infusion duration (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.81; 5 studies; 557 participants). The majority of participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. For different anthracycline peak doses, we identified two RCTs addressing a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 versus 60 mg/m2 or more, one RCT addressing a liposomal doxorubicin peak dose of 25 mg/m2 versus 50 mg/m2, and one RCT addressing an epirubicin peak dose of 83 mg/m2 versus 110 mg/m2. A significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure was identified in none of the studies. The participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumours. High or unclear 'Risk of bias' issues were present in all studies. An anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage. Since there is only a small amount of data for children and data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children. We identified no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure in participants treated with a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 or more. Only one RCT was available for the other identified peak doses, so we can make no definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. More high-quality research is needed, both in children and adults and in leukaemias and solid tumours.","The evidence is current to December 2015. We found 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion durations (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak doses (5280 participants). Participants had different types of cancer. For the use of different anthracycline infusion durations, the authors found that an anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure (for example shortness of breath or leg oedema), and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical heart failure (that is heart damage diagnosed for example by an echocardiography in people without symptoms). Only a small amount of data was available for children and individuals with leukaemia, since most studies evaluating different anthracycline infusion durations were performed in adults with solid tumours. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to favour either a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 or more. There was not enough high-quality evidence available for the use of other anthracycline peak doses to be able to draw conclusions. No data were available for children and individuals with leukaemia. Further high-quality research is needed. All studies had problems relating to quality of the evidence."
CD010041,"Three randomised controlled trials involving 2270 women from high-income countries were eligible for inclusion in the review. Outcomes were reported for 1280 infants in one study. The interventions assessed in the trials were designed to be used either independently by women or mediated through the involvement of independent support. No studies looked at shared decision supports, that is, interventions designed to facilitate shared decision-making with health professionals during clinical encounters. We found no difference in planned mode of birth: VBAC (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.10; I² = 0%) or caesarean birth (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.10; I² = 0%). The proportion of women unsure about preference did not change (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.20; I² = 0%). There was no difference in adverse outcomes reported between intervention and control groups (one trial, 1275 women/1280 babies): permanent (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.36); severe (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.36); unclear (0.66, 95% CI 0.27, 1.61). Overall, 64.8% of those indicating preference for VBAC achieved it, while 97.1% of those planning caesarean birth achieved this mode of birth. We found no difference in the proportion of women achieving congruence between preferred and actual mode of birth (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07) (three trials, 1921 women). More women had caesarean births (57.3%), including 535 women where it was unplanned (42.6% all caesarean deliveries and 24.4% all births). We found no difference in actual mode of birth between groups, (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06) (three trials, 2190 women). Decisional conflict about preferred mode of birth was lower (less uncertainty) for women with decisional support (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.02; two trials, 787 women; I² = 48%). There was also a significant increase in knowledge among women with decision support compared with those in the control group (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03; two trials, 787 women; I² = 65%). However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the two studies contributing to this outcome ( I² = 65%) and attrition was greater than 15 per cent and the evidence for this outcome is considered to be moderate quality only. There was no difference in satisfaction between women with decision support and those without it (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.20; two trials, 797 women; I² = 0%). No study assessed decisional regret or whether women's information needs were met. Qualitative data gathered in interviews with women and health professionals provided information about acceptability of the decision support and its feasibility of implementation. While women liked the decision support there was concern among health professionals about their impact on their time and workload. Evidence is limited to independent and mediated decision supports. Research is needed on shared decision support interventions for women considering mode of birth in a pregnancy after a caesarean birth to use with their care providers.","We found three studies (involving 2270 women), all from high-income countries, that were suitable for this review. The studies looked at the effectiveness of decision support tools designed to be used either independently by women or mediated through the involvement of someone not associated with their care support. No studies looked at shared decision support tools that were intended to help with shared decision making with the pregnant women and their health professionals during pregnancy care visits. We found that the use of these decision support tools made no difference to the type of birth women planned, how women actually gave birth, or in the number of women and babies who experienced harm, although only one study reported harms. There was also no difference in the proportion of women who were unsure about what they wanted. Overall, nearly 65% of women who wanted a VBAC achieved it, while almost all women wanting a caesarean birth had one (97%). We found no difference in the proportion of women who achieved their preferred mode of birth. However, women who used decisional support interventions had less uncertainty about their decision than those that did not use them. Research is needed on the effectiveness of decision support interventions designed to be shared between women and the health professionals caring for them in pregnancy after a caesarean birth."
CD009577,"We included six RCTs with a total of 3753 participants and we graded the quality of the included studies as moderate. All studies included women with an indication for COS as part of an IVF/ICSI cycle with age ranging from 18 to 41 years. A comparison of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH did not show evidence of difference in effect on overall live birth rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.07; 2363 participants, five studies; I² statistic = 44%) or OHSS (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.37; 3753 participants, six studies; I² statistic = 0%). We compared subgroups by dose of long-acting FSH. There was evidence of a reduced live birth rate in women who received lower doses (60 to 120 μg) of long-acting FSH compared to daily FSH (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; 645 participants, three studies; I² statistic = 0%). There was no evidence a difference between the groups in live births in the medium dose (150 to 180 μg) subgroup (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; 1685 participants, four studies; I² statistic = 6%). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the clinical pregnancy rate (any dose), ongoing pregnancy rate (any dose), multiple pregnancy rate (any dose), miscarriage rate (low or medium dose), ectopic pregnancy rate (any dose), congenital malformation rate, congenital malformation rate; major or minor (low or medium dose). The use of a medium dose (150 to 180 μg) of long-acting FSH is a safe treatment option and equally effective compared to daily FSH in women with unexplained subfertility. There was evidence of reduced live birth rate in women receiving a low dose (60 to 120 μg) of long-acting FSH compared to daily FSH. Further research is needed to determine whether long-acting FSH is safe and effective for use in hyper- or poor responders and in women with all causes of subfertility.","We included six randomised controlled trials comparing weekly versus daily FSH in 3753 women undertaking controlled ovarian stimulation as part of an IVF/ICSI cycle. Their age ranged from 18 to 41 years. The studies used different dosages of weekly FSH ranging from 60 to 240 μg. Five studies reported live birth rate and all six studies reported OHSS rate (our primary outcomes). The evidence is current to June 2015. There was no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between medium dose (150 to 180 μg) weekly FSH and daily FSH. There was evidence of a reduced live birth rate in women who received lower doses (60 to 120 μg) of weekly FSH when compared to daily FSH. Only one study used a high dose of weekly FSH, so we cannot make conclusions about this dosage group.There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in OHSS rate. We concluded that medium dose (150 to 180 μg) weekly FSH is a safe treatment option and is as effective in terms of life birth rate as daily FSH injections. The quality of the evidence was graded as moderate. Five out of six studies were funded by the same drug manufacturer."
CD011686,"Three cohort studies were eligible for analysis, including 3380 patients ; 96 children were diagnosed with CSI. One study evaluated the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rule and the NEXUS criteria, and two studies evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria. The studies were of moderate quality. Due to the small number of included studies and the diverse outcomes of those studies, we could not describe a pooled estimate for the diagnostic test accuracy. The sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria of the individual studies was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.90), 0.98 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). The specificity of the NEXUS criteria was 0.35 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.45), 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.62) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.21). For the Canadian C-spine Rule the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and specificity was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.23). Since the quantity of the data was small we were not able to investigate heterogeneity. There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and CCR in children. At the moment, there is not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rule to detect CSI in pediatric trauma patients following blunt trauma. The confidence interval of the sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria between the individual studies showed a wide range, with a lower limit varying from 0.18 to 0.91 with a total of four false negative test results, meaning that if physicians use the NEXUS criteria in children, there is a chance of missing CSI. Since missing CSI could have severe consequences with the risk of significant morbidity, we consider that the NEXUS criteria are at best a guide to clinical assessment, with current evidence not supporting strict or protocolized adoption of the tool into pediatric trauma care. Moreover, we have to keep in mind that the sensitivity differs among several studies, and individual confidence intervals of these studies show a wide range. Our main conclusion is therefore that additional well-designed studies with large sample sizes are required to better evaluate the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C-spine Rule, or both, in order to determine whether they are appropriate triage tools for the clearance of the cervical spine in children following blunt trauma.","We searched medical literature databases to identify studies which tested how well both decision tools can establish whether children are at risk for CSI after blunt trauma. We performed the search in February 2015. We identified three studies of moderate to good quality. All studies tested the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria, and one of them also tested the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rules. Since only one study looked at the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rules, there is not enough evidence at the moment to determine whether the Canadian C-spine Rules can be used safely in children. The sensitivity and specificity of the NEXUS criteria varied among the three studies, meaning that there is a chance of false-negative test results when using the NEXUS criteria, and as a result there is a chance of missing cervical spine injury if doctors only rely on the NEXUS criteria. We therefore consider that the NEXUS criteria are at best a guide to clinical assessment, with current evidence not supporting strict or protocolized adoption of the tool into pediatric trauma care. The conclusion of our review is that we need more research to evaluate the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine rules for routine use in children."
CD012301,"Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Three included studies compared extended-field RT versus pelvic RT, one included study compared extended-field RT with pelvic CRT, and one study compared extended-field CRT versus pelvic CRT. Extended-field radiotherapy versus pelvic radiotherapy alone
Compared to pelvic RT, extended-field RT probably reduces the risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.94; 1 study; 337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and para-aortic lymph node recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.70; 2 studies; 477 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), although there may or may not have been improvement in the risk of disease progression (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22; 1 study; 337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and severe adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.41; 2 studies; 776 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Extended-field radiotherapy versus pelvic chemoradiotherapy
In a comparison of extended-field RT versus pelvic CRT, women given pelvic CRT probably had a lower risk of death (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64; 1 study; 389 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and disease progression (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.72; 1 study; 389 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants given extended-field RT may or may not have had a lower risk of para-aortic lymph node recurrence (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.99; 1 study; 389 participants; low-certainty evidence) and acute severe adverse events (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; 1 study; 388 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in terms of late severe adverse events among the comparison groups (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.62; 1 study; 386 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Extended-field chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic chemoradiotherapy
Very low-certainty evidence obtained from one small study (74 participants) showed that, compared to pelvic CRT, extended-field CRT may or may not have reduced risk of death (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.96) and disease progression (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.87). There were no clear differences between the groups in the risks of para-aortic lymph node recurrence (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.54; very low-certainty evidence) and severe adverse events (acute: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.39; late: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.59; very low-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that, compared with pelvic RT alone, extended-field RT probably improves overall survival and reduces risk of para-aortic lymph node recurrence. However, pelvic RT alone would now be considered substandard treatment, so this result cannot be extrapolated to modern standards of care. Low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests that pelvic CRT may increase overall and progression-free survival compared to extended-field RT, although there may or may not be a higher rate of para-aortic recurrence and acute adverse events. Extended-field CRT versus pelvic CRT may improve overall or progression-free survival, but these findings should be interpreted with caution due to very low-certainty evidence. High-quality RCTs, comparing modern treatment techniques in CRT, are needed to more fully inform treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer without obvious para-aortic node involvement.","We searched databases from their inception to August 2018 and found five studies that met the inclusion criteria. Three studies compared extended-field RT versus pelvic RT. None of these three studies compared against the current gold-standard of pelvic CRT. One study compared extended-field RT versus pelvic CRT and one study compared extended-field CRT versus pelvic CRT. Compared with pelvic RT alone, women given extended-field RT may have been less likely to die and probably were less likely to have a cervical cancer come back (recurrence) in the para-aortic lymph nodes. However, extended-field RT may have made little or no difference to how often their cancer recurred elsewhere and how often they experience severe side effects. Pelvic CRT is the modern standard of treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. In a comparison of extended-field RT alone versus pelvic CRT, women given pelvic CRT were probably less likely to die or have recurrence of their cancer. Women given extended-field RT alone may have been less likely to experience a recurrence within the para-aortic lymph nodes and have had adverse events during or shortly after treatment. There were no clear differences regarding the late adverse events between the two groups. Women given extended-field CRT may or may not have been less likely to die or have cancer progression than those women pelvic CRT. There were no clear differences in the chances of experiencing a cancer recurrence in the para-aortic lymph nodes and severe side effects between the groups. The evidence for outcomes in the comparison of extended-field RT alone versus pelvic RT alone were of moderate certainty. In the comparison of extended-field RT versus pelvic CRT, the evidence regarding the survival and side effects were of moderate certainty. The evidence for para-aortic recurrence was of low certainty. The evidence for all outcomes in a comparison of extended-field CRT versus pelvic CRT were of very-low certainty because of concerns regarding the high risk of bias and results coming from a single trial of very few women. We are moderately certain that, compared with pelvic RT alone, extended-field RT probably improves overall survival and reduces risk of para-aortic lymph node recurrence. However, pelvic RT alone would now not be considered the standard of care in women well enough to receive CRT, so these results should be reviewed with caution and cannot be extrapolated to modern treatment techniques. Low- to moderate-certainty evidence supports the use of pelvic CRT rather than extended-field RT alone, as it appears to reduce the risk of death and cancer progression. The likelihood of experiencing unwanted side effects during treatment was higher among women receiving pelvic CRT than extended-field RT. Evidence comparing extended-field CRT to pelvic CRT was very low certainty regarding outcomes and it may or may not improve survival."
CD006242,"The review found seven trials, involving 1497 patients, which met the criteria to be included. The trials were generally of moderate methodological quality; two studies have not published their results on overall survival so the presence of selective outcome reporting bias cannot be ruled out. None of the studies used blinding to treatment allocation, though this is unlikely to have biased the results for overall survival. Studies varied in terms of co-administered regimen and in terms of treatment line. In four studies, trastuzumab was administered with a chemotherapy, such as a taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing or capecitabine-containing regimen. Two studies considered postmenopausal women and administered trastuzumab with hormone-blocking medications, such as an aromatase inhibitor. One study administered trastuzumab in addition to lapatinib. Five studies out of seven included women treated with trastuzumab administered until progression as first-line treatment and two studies considered trastuzumab beyond progression. The combined HRs for overall survival and progression-free survival favoured the trastuzumab-containing regimens (HR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.94, P = 0.004; and HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.70, P < 0.00001, respectively; moderate-quality evidence). Trastuzumab increased the risk of congestive heart failure (RR 3.49, 90% CI 1.88 to 6.47, P = 0.0009; moderate-quality evidence) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline (RR 2.65, 90% CI 1.48 to 4.74, P = 0.006). For haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia, there was no clear evidence that risks differed between groups, while trastuzumab seemed to raise the risk of neutropenia. The overall survival improvement was maintained when considering patients treated as first-line or patients receiving taxane-based regimens. The progression-free survival improvement was maintained when considering patients receiving taxane-based regimens, and patients treated as first-line or subsequent lines. Few data were collected on central nervous system progression. Similarly, few studies reported on quality of life and treatment-related deaths. Trastuzumab improved overall survival and progression-free survival in HER2-positive women with metastatic breast cancer, but it also increased the risk of cardiac toxicities, such as congestive heart failure and LVEF decline. The available subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of studies. Studies that administered trastuzumab as first-line treatment, or along with a taxane-based regimen, improved mortality outcomes. The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond progression is limited. The recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is generally used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer in clinical practice, while women enrolled in most of the trials in the metastatic setting were naive to trastuzumab. The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is therefore still an open issue, although it is likely that the majority are being offered it again.","We included seven trials with 1497 women who had HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in this review. They were assigned by chance to receive trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy (taxane, anthracycline or capecitabine in four studies), hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors including letrozole or anastrozole in two studies) or targeted therapy (lapatinib in one study). Women treated with trastuzumab were followed up until disease progression in five studies and beyond disease progression in two studies. The length of trastuzumab administration varied between 8.7 and 30 months, and follow-up averaged two years after starting trastuzumab. All studies found that trastuzumab extends time to disease progression, with gains varying between two and 11 months, and in five studies it extended time to death by between five and eight months. However, some patients develop severe heart toxicity (congestive heart failure) during treatment. While trastuzumab reduces breast cancer mortality by one-fifth, the risk of heart toxicity is between three and four times more likely. If 1000 women were given standard therapy alone (with no trastuzumab) about 300 would survive and 10 would have heart toxicities. With the addition of trastuzumab to this treatment, an additional 73 would have their lives prolonged, and an additional 25 would have severe heart toxicity. Omitting the anthracycline-trastuzumab arms (which would not be regarded as standard of care) 21 patients would have severe heart toxicity (11 more than the chemotherapy alone group). These heart toxicities are often reversible if the treatment is stopped once heart disease is discovered. Women with advanced disease might choose to accept this risk. On balance, this review shows that with trastuzumab the time to disease progression and survival benefits outweigh the risk of heart harm. Trastuzumab does not increase the risk of haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia; however, it seems to raise the risk of neutropenia. There were insufficient data on the impact of trastuzumab on quality of life, treatment-related deaths and brain metastases to reach a conclusion for these outcomes. We rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate, with the main weaknesses being the fact that all studies included were open-label (not blinded), which may have affected the outcome assessments for time to disease progression and toxicities, and that two studies have not published their results for mortality. Furthermore, the recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at disease progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab on mortality. The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond disease progression is limited. It is important to highlight that, although trastuzumab is used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, the women enrolled in these metastatic trials were not previously treated with trastuzumab. The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is still an open issue, although it is likely that it is offered to the majority of them."
CD004040,"Six trials (1422 participants) were included in the review. There was a high rate of failure to complete treatment on all treatments which may have biased the estimates of relative efficacy. Olanzapine was superior to placebo at reducing manic symptoms as monotherapy (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) - weighted mean difference (WMD): -5.94, 95% CI -9.09 to -2.80) and in combination with lithium/valproate (YMRS) (WMD -4.01, 95% confidence interval -6.06 to -1.96). Olanzapine monotherapy was superior at reducing psychotic symptoms (PANSS positive symptoms subscale WMD: -3.54, 95% CI -5.28 to -1.80). Olanzapine was superior to divalproex at reducing manic symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD): -0.29, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.08). Olanzapine did not lead to a statistically higher rate of clinical response than haloperidol (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.38). Fewer patients discontinued treatment on olanzapine than placebo (RR: 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80). Olanzapine caused greater weight gain than placebo (WMD 1.91Kg, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.53) and somnolence (RR: 2.13 95% CI 1.62 to 2.79) but not more depressive symptoms (RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.40) or movement disorder (WMD: -0.33, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.09). Olanzapine caused more prolactin elevation than placebo (RR: 4.35 95%CI 1.77 to 10.70). Olanzapine caused greater weight gain (WMD: 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05); somnolence (RR: 1.80 95% CI 1.32 to 2.46) and movement disorders (SAS - WMD: 0.72 95% CI 0.11 to 1.33) than divalproex but less nausea ( RR: 0.36 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65). Olanzapine caused more weight gain than haloperidol (RR: 3.59, 95% CI 1.49 to 8.64) but less movement disorder (EPS RR: 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.24). Olanzapine is an effective treatment for mania and may be more efficacious than divalproex, though leads to more weight gain. Clinicians should consider both the relative efficacy and the different incidence of specific adverse effects of available drugs.","High withdrawal rates from the trials limit the confidence that can be placed on the results. Olanzapine was superior to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms both as monotherapy and combined with mood stabilizers, though caused weight gain. Olanzapine was more efficacious than divalproex and caused less nausea but more weight gain, somnolence and movement disorders. Olanzapine was comparable to haloperidol in efficacy, caused less movement disorders but greater weight gain."
CD011968,"We included four trials (three parallel-group RCTs and one cross-over trial) involving a total of 139 participants. This result was unchanged from the review published in 2019. Blinding of participants and physicians was well reported in three trials, with no information on whether personnel were blinded in one trial. We judged the overall risk of bias across trials as low. Only two trials (with 63 and 18 participants, respectively) provided sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis. We found no clear effect of rPMS on activities of daily living at the end of treatment (mean difference (MD) −3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) −16.35 to 10.35; P = 0.66; 1 trial; 63 participants; low-certainty evidence) and at the end of follow-up (MD −2.00, 95% CI −14.86 to 10.86; P = 0.76; 1 trial; 63 participants; low-certainty evidence) when comparing rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham rPMS plus rehabilitation. We found no statistical difference in improvement of upper limb function at the end of treatment (MD 2.00, 95% CI −4.91 to 8.91; P = 0.57; 1 trial; 63 participants; low-certainty evidence) and at the end of follow-up (MD 4.00, 95% CI −2.92 to 10.92; P = 0.26; 1 trial; 63 participants; low-certainty evidence) when comparing rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham rPMS plus rehabilitation. We observed a decrease in spasticity of the elbow at the end of follow-up (MD −0.41, 95% CI −0.89 to 0.07; 1 trial; 63 participants; low-certainty evidence) when comparing rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham rPMS plus rehabilitation. In terms of muscle strength, rPMS treatment was not associated with improved muscle strength of the ankle dorsiflexors at the end of treatment (MD 3.00, 95% CI −2.44 to 8.44; P = 0.28; 1 trial; 18 participants; low-certainty evidence) when compared with sham rPMS. No studies provided information on lower limb function or adverse events, including death. Based on the GRADE approach, we judged the certainty of evidence related to the primary outcome as low, owing to the small sample size of the studies. There is insufficient evidence to permit the drawing of any conclusions about routine use of rPMS for people after stroke. Additional trials with large sample sizes are needed to provide robust evidence for rPMS after stroke.","This is an update of the review published in 2019. We examined the evidence from four randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of rPMS involving a total of 139 participants. Two studies compared rPMS against 'sham' stimulation (a very weak stimulation or a sound only). Two studies compared rPMS plus rehabilitation versus sham plus rehabilitation. We found little evidence for the use of rPMS to improve activities of daily living, muscle strength, upper limb function, and spasticity (unusual stiffness of muscles) in people after stroke. The current result is unchanged from the review published in 2019. Although one trial reported that rPMS reduced spasticity of the upper limb, the effect was small and remains unclear. We classified the quality of the evidence as low for improving activities of daily living, mainly because one study had a small sample size. It remains unclear whether rPMS is useful in improving activities of daily living and functional ability in people after stroke. More trials involving larger numbers of participants are needed to determine the effects of rPMS."
CD006431,"This review included two randomised controlled trials. The first trial included 200 women who were randomised to receive uterine massage or no massage following delivery of the placenta, after active management of the third stage of labour including use of oxytocin. The numbers of women with blood loss more than 500 mL was small, with no statistically significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 1.67). There were no cases of retained placenta in either group. The mean blood loss was significantly less in the uterine massage group at 30 minutes (mean difference (MD) -41.60 mL, 95% CI -75.16 to -8.04) and 60 minutes after trial entry (MD -77.40 mL, 95% CI -118.71 to -36.09). The need for additional uterotonics was significantly reduced in the uterine massage group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.50). For use of uterine massage before and after delivery of the placenta, one trial recruited 1964 women in Egypt and South Africa. Women were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby but before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage plus oxytocin over oxytocin alone as regards blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mL (average RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.44, 5.49; random-effects) or need for additional use of uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.85). The two trials were combined to examine the effect of uterine massage commenced either before or after delivery of the placenta. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the blood loss 500 mL or more after trial entry. The average effect using a random-effects model found no statistically significant differences between groups (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.32; random-effects). The results of this review are inconclusive, and should not be interpreted as a reason to change current practice. Due to the limitations of the included trials, more trials with sufficient numbers of women are needed in order to estimate the effects of sustained uterine massage. All the women compared in this review received oxytocin as part of the active management of labour. Recent research suggests that once an oxytocic has been given, there is limited scope for further reduction in postpartum blood loss. Trials of uterine massage in settings where uterotonics are not available, and which measure women's experience of the procedure, are needed.","In one trial involving 200 women, uterine massage was given every 10 minutes for 60 minutes after delivery of the placenta effectively reduced blood loss, and the need for additional uterotonics, by some 80%. The numbers of women losing more than 500 mL of blood were too small for meaningful comparison. Two women in the control group and none in the uterine massage group needed blood transfusions. The second trial involved 1964 women who were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby and before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage when oxytocin was used. The results of this review are inconclusive. The methodological quality of the two included trials was high but it is possible that there were differences in the procedures used in the study sites. Disadvantages of uterine massage include the use of staff time, and discomfort caused to women. The findings should not change the recommended practice. It is likely that any reduction in blood loss was limited with the use of oxytocin in these trials. Uterine massage may also have increased apparent blood loss by pressing pooled blood out from the uterine cavity. There is a need for more trials, especially in settings where uterotonics are not available. Uterine massage could be a simple inexpensive intervention if proved effective."
CD002147,"Twenty studies were identified for all the comparison groups, involving 1609 patients. There were seven studies (with 443 patients) comparing terlipressin to placebo, five of which were considered to be high quality studies based on the Jadad scale. The meta-analysis indicates that terlipressin was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all cause mortality compared to placebo (relative risk 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.88). Three studies (with 302 patients) were identified comparing terlipressin to somatostatin, two of which were high quality studies; only one high quality study (219 patients) comparing terlipressin to endoscopic treatment was identified. Within the limited power provided by these small numbers of patients, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated between terlipressin and either somatostatin or endoscopic treatment in any of the outcomes. For the remaining comparison groups (terlipressin versus balloon tamponade, terlipressin versus octreotide, and terlipressin versus vasopressin) only small, low quality studies were identified and no difference was demonstrated in any of the major outcomes. There was no significant difference between the terlipressin group and any of the comparison groups in the number of adverse events that caused death or withdrawal of medication. On the basis of a 34% relative risk reduction in mortality, terlipressin should be considered to be effective in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. Further, since no other vasoactive agent has been shown to reduce mortality in single studies or meta-analyses, terlipressin might be the vasoactive agent of choice in acute variceal bleeding.","The reviewers evaluated the safety and effectiveness of a drug called terlipressin: they reported that terlipressin appears to be as safe as other treatments and that terlipressin may reduce the mortality from variceal bleeding as compared to placebo. The reviewers did not have sufficient data to decide whether terlipressin was better or worse than other available treatments such as other drugs (somatostatin, octreotide) or endoscopic treatment."
CD002765,"Twenty-three trials (1459 patients) fulfilled the selection criteria for this review. NSAIDs reduced creatinine clearance by 16 mL/min (95% CI 5 to 28) and potassium output by 38 mmol/day (95% CI 19 to 56) on the first day after surgery compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine on the first day (0 μmol/L, 95% CI -3 to 4) compared to placebo. No significant reduction in urine volume during the early postoperative period was found. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early postoperative period between patients receiving diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin, ketoprofen or etodolac. No cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis were described. The trials were not heterogeneous for the primary outcome. NSAIDs caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period in patients with normal preoperative renal function. NSAIDs should not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment.","The review of trials found that NSAIDs can cause small, temporary negative effects on the kidneys in adults, but no one in the trials experienced renal failure or serious kidney problems. These results may not apply to children or adults with decreased kidney function"
CD009974,"Nine RCTs (N = 341 participants, 301 included in analyses) investigated various types and intensities of non pharmacological interventions for treating spasticity in adults with MS. These interventions included: physical activity programmes (such as physiotherapy, structured exercise programme, sports climbing); transcranial magnetic stimulation (Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)); electromagnetic therapy (pulsed electromagnetic therapy; magnetic pulsing device), Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS); and Whole Body Vibration (WBV). All studies scored 'low' on the methodological quality assessment implying high risk of bias. There is 'low level' evidence for physical activity programmes used in isolation or in combination with other interventions (pharmacological or non pharmacological), and for repetitive magnetic stimulation (iTBS/rTMS) with or without adjuvant exercise therapy in improving spasticity in adults with MS. No evidence of benefit exists to support the use of TENS, sports climbing and vibration therapy for treating spasticity in this population. There is 'low level' evidence for non pharmacological interventions such as physical activities given in conjunction with other interventions, and for magnetic stimulation and electromagnetic therapies for beneficial effects on spasticity outcomes in people with MS. A wide range of non pharmacological interventions are used for the treatment of spasticity in MS, but more robust trials are needed to build evidence about these interventions.","In this review, nine studies evaluating various non drug treatments to treat spasticity in adult with MS were included, comprising a total of 341 participants. Results from these studies suggest that all included non pharmacological therapies have low level of evidence or no evidence in improving spasticity in people with MS. However, caution should be used in the interpretation of the results, due to the poor methodological quality of all the included studies. More research is needed to determine the usefulness of these interventions before they can be recommended as routine treatments."
CD008077,"We identified one new study for this update, resulting in a total of five included studies with 503 participants who received subcutaneous injections of LMWH into the abdomen. Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind participants and caregivers (personnel) in any of the included studies. Two studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Overall, the methodological quality of included studies was moderate. The duration of the fast injection was 10 seconds, and the duration of the slow injection was 30 seconds in all included studies. Four studies reported site pain intensity after each injection at different time points. Two studies assessed site pain intensity immediately after each injection; meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference in site pain intensity immediately after slow injection when compared to fast injection (MD −1.52, 95% CI −3.56 to 0.53; 140 participants; low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis of three studies indicated that site pain intensity may be slightly reduced 48 hours after the slow heparin injection compared to fast injection (MD −1.60, 95% CI −2.69 to −0.51; 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). Five studies assessed bruise size at 48 hours, and two studies assessed bruise size at 60 hours. Meta-analysis showed there may be a reduction in bruise size 48 hours (SMD −0.54, 95% CI −1.05 to −0.02; 503 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence) and 60 hours (SMD −0.49, 95% CI −0.93 to −0.06; 84 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) after slow injection compared to fast injection. There was no evidence of a difference in bruise size 72 hours after slow injection compared to fast injection (SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.61 to 0.06; 140 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). Three studies evaluated incidence of bruising and showed there may be a reduction in bruise incidence 48 hours (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.60; 444 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 60 hours (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.65; 84 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence) after slow injection compared to fast injection. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to risk of bias concerns, imprecision, and inconsistency. None of the included studies measured size or incidence of haematoma. Administering medication safely and enhancing patient comfort are the main aims of clinical nurses. In this review, we identified five RCTs that evaluated the effect of subcutaneous heparin injection duration on pain intensity, bruise size and incidence. We found that pain may be slightly reduced 48 hours after slow injection. Similarly, there may be a reduction in bruise size and incidence after slow injection compared to fast injection 48 and 60 hours postinjection. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to low or very low due to risk of bias concerns, imprecision, and inconsistency. Accordingly, new trials with a more robust design, more participants, and a focus on different injection speeds will be useful in strengthening the certainty of the available evidence.","We searched for studies that investigated the effects of speed of injection on the amount of pain and bruising where the injection is given (current to 22 June 2020). Five studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The included studies took place in Thailand, Turkey, Italy, and China, and enrolled a total of 503 people (312 female and 191 male participants). All study participants received LMWH, whilst no study used UFH. Study investigators injected heparin into the abdomen of participants. Participants could watch the injection being given and knew whether it was fast (10 seconds long) or slow (30 seconds long). We found that pain may be slightly reduced 48 hours after slow injection compared with fast injection. Similarly, there may be smaller bruise sizes and fewer bruises with the slow injection 48 and 60 hours after the injection. None of the included studies measured the number or size of haematomas. We graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low because we found only a small number of published studies that reported on our review question, and the studies were small and had contradicting results. The fact that participants knew whether they had received a fast or a slow injection may also have affected the results because this knowledge may have led them to use different techniques (i.e. applying cold, heat, or massage) to relieve the pain and bruising based on the intervention received."
CD012457,"We identified one quasi-RCT and two RCTs, involving a total of 390 women. One study performed retropubic urethropexy surgery requiring a transverse suprapubic incision, while the other two studies performed midurethral sling surgery. It should be noted that none of the included studies clearly specified the timing of outcome assessment. We are very uncertain whether prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin) have an effect on surgical site infections (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.03 to 12.35; 2 studies, 85 women; very low-certainty evidence) or urinary tract infections or bacteriuria (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.05 to 13.24; 2 studies, 85 women; very low-certainty evidence). The effect of prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin) on febrile morbidity is also uncertain (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.29; 2 studies, 85 women; very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin) have any effect on mesh exposure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.61; 1 study, 59 women; very low-certainty evidence). None of the three included studies described the assessment of adverse events from antibiotic use, sepsis or bacteraemia in their reports. Only limited data are available from the three included studies and, overall, the certainty of evidence was very low. Moreover, the three included studies evaluated different surgical procedures and dosages of antibiotic administration. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection following anti-incontinence surgery. In addition, there were no data regarding adverse effects of prophylactic antibiotics. More RCTs are required.","We included three studies (in seven reports) involving a total of 390 women who underwent one of two different continence surgeries and were given one of three different doses of antibiotics (cefazolin) or placebo or no treatment. The sample sizes in the trials ranged from 26 to 305 women. None of the included studies clearly indicated the timing of the outcome assessment. The average age of the women ranged from 45 to 54 years. Two studies received no funding; the third study did not provide funding information. Preventive antibiotics may have little to no effect on surgical site infections, urinary tract infections or bacteriuria (presence of bacteria in the urine), fever after surgery or the appearance of the artificial tape or mesh used in the surgery through the skin beneath the urethra, but we are very uncertain about the results. None of the included studies reported data on adverse effects, sepsis or bacteraemia related to taking antibiotics, or bacterial antibiotic resistance. We are uncertain about our findings as they are based on only three small studies. Each study assessed the effectiveness of preventive antibiotics in different surgical procedures, antibiotic dosages and outcomes. In addition, each included study had a small sample size and some were conducted in ways that might incorporate flaws into their results. Our findings may alter when results from better quality and large RCTs become available."
CD008125,"We included three short-term and one long-term trial (total N=221). All participants had schizophrenia that was either treatment-resistant or with prominent negative symptoms. All studies compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine (+/- placebo), were small and at considerable risk of bias. Short-term data of 'no clinically significant response' in global state tended to favour sulpiride augmentation of clozapine compared with clozapine alone (n=193, 3 RCTs, RR 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.09). People allocated to sulpiride plus clozapine had more movement disorders (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 48.24 CI 3.05 to 762.56) and an increase in serum prolactin (skewed data, 1 RCT), but less incidence of hypersalivation (n=162, 3 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.29 to 0.83) and less weight gain (n=64, 1 RCT, RR 0.30 CI 0.09 to 0.99). The augmentation of clozapine by sulpiride also caused less appetite loss (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.70, NNT 4 CI 4 to 12, Z=2.31, P=0.02) and less abdominal distension (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.10 CI 0.01 to 0.78, NNT 5 CI 4 to 19, Z=2.20, P=0.03). Long-term data showed no significant difference in global state (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.42 to 1.08) and relapse (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.85 CI 0.5 to 1.3). Sulpiride plus clozapine is probably more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people whose illness has been resistant to other antipsychotic drugs including clozapine. However, much more robust data are needed.","Several clinical trials reported effects of sulpiride augmentation for management of schizophrenia. We included four small trials which compared sulpiride plus clozapine with clozapine alone for very ill people. Evidence from the present review suggested that short-term sulpiride plus clozapine probably is more effective than clozapine alone in producing clinical improvement in some people. The evidence is, however, weak and prone to considerable bias. This is a good area for more research."
CD009467,"Our search located 17 eligible records reporting on 11 unique studies with 297,994 participants; the studies examined academic outcomes, amount and quality of sleep, mental health indicators, attendance, and student alertness. Overall, the quality of the body of evidence was very low, as we rated most studies as being at high or unclear risk of bias with respect to allocation, attrition, absence of randomization, and the collection of baseline data. Therefore, we cannot be confident about the effects of later school start times. Preliminary evidence from the included studies indicated a potential association between later school start times and academic and psychosocial outcomes, but quality and comparability of these data were low and often precluded quantitative synthesis. Four studies examined the association between later school start times and academic outcomes, reporting mixed results. Six studies examined effects on total amount of sleep and reported significant, positive relationships between later school start times and amount of sleep. One study provided information concerning mental health outcomes, reporting an association between decreased depressive symptoms and later school start times. There were mixed results for the association between later school start times and absenteeism. Three studies reported mixed results concerning the association between later school start times and student alertness. There was limited indication of potential adverse effects on logistics, as the qualitative portions of one study reported less interaction between parents and children, and another reported staffing and scheduling difficulties. Because of the insufficient evidence, we cannot draw firm conclusions concerning adverse effects at this time. It is important to note the limitations of this evidence, especially as randomized controlled trials and high-quality primary studies are difficult to conduct; school systems are often unwilling or unable to allow researchers the necessary control over scheduling and data collection. Moreover, this evidence does not speak to the process of implementing later school starts, as the included studies focused on reporting the effects rather than exploring the process. This systematic review on later school start times suggests several potential benefits for this intervention and points to the need for higher quality primary studies. However, as a result of the limited evidence base, we could not determine the effects of later school start times with any confidence.","The evidence included in this review is current as of February 2016 and is based on 17 reports representing 11 unique studies in 297,994 high school students. The studies examined a range of changes to school time (for example, moving the start time fifteen minutes later, moving the start time an hour later) and a range of intervention durations (one as short as two weeks, others lasting a year), but all focused on natural settings (students already in schools, rather than in a laboratory setting). Although 5 of the 11 studies were funded, the funding sources were academic and research institutions, rather than agencies with a commercial interest in program evaluation results. Because of the limited and very low-quality evidence, we could not determine the effects of later school start times with any confidence. We found that later school start times may provide academic benefits, but results of four studies provided mixed findings. Later school starts were associated with an increase in school-night sleep for students based on the synthesis of two studies, and evidence from six other studies also supported the relationship between later school starts and increased sleep duration. One study reported that students in later starting schools reported fewer depressive symptoms than their peers in earlier starting schools. Different studies reported mixed findings regarding the association between later school start times and increased attendance and student alertness. These interventions may also have potential adverse effects on logistics, as the qualitative portions of one study reported less interaction between parents and children, and another reported staffing and scheduling difficulties. Again, because of the limited and very low-quality evidence, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the adverse effects of later school start times. The quality of this evidence was very low, and thus we cannot assume the findings reflect the true beneficial or adverse effects of later school start times."
CD010664,"We included 10 randomised trials (836 participants) in this review. Four trials (40%) had low risk of bias, the remaining 60% of trials had a high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for the effects of CBT on patients with chronic NP was from very low to moderate. There was low quality evidence that CBT was better than no treatment for improving pain (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.01 to -0.16), disability (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.21 to -0.01), and quality of life (SMD -0.93, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.31) at short-term follow-up, while there was from very low to low quality evidence of no effect on various psychological indicators at short-term follow-up. Both at short- and intermediate-term follow-up, CBT did not affect pain (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.21, low quality, at short-term follow-up; MD -0.89, 95% CI -2.73 to 0.94, low quality, at intermediate-term follow-up) or disability (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.20, moderate quality, at short-term follow-up; SMD -0.24, 95% CI-0.54 to 0.07, moderate quality, at intermediate-term follow-up) compared to other types of interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that CBT was better than other interventions for improving kinesiophobia at intermediate-term follow-up (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.08, I2 = 0%). Finally, there was very low quality evidence that CBT in addition to another intervention did not differ from the other intervention alone in terms of effect on pain (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.02) and disability (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.36) at short-term follow-up. For patients with subacute NP, there was low quality evidence that CBT was better than other interventions at reducing pain at short-term follow-up (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.00), while no difference was found in terms of effect on disability (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.12) and kinesiophobia. None of the included studies reported on adverse effects. With regard to chronic neck pain, CBT was found to be statistically significantly more effective for short-term pain reduction only when compared to no treatment, but these effects could not be considered clinically meaningful. When comparing both CBT to other types of interventions and CBT in addition to another intervention to the other intervention alone, no differences were found. For patients with subacute NP, CBT was significantly better than other types of interventions at reducing pain at short-term follow-up, while no difference was found for disability and kinesiophobia. Further research is recommended to investigate the long-term benefits and risks of CBT including for the different subgroups of subjects with NP.","We examined the research published up to November 2014. We included 10 randomised trials (836 participants). Two studies included subjects with subacute NP (337 participants), while the other eight studies included participants with chronic NP (499 participants). CBTwas compared to no treatment (225 participants) or to other types of treatments (506 participants), or combined with another intervention (e.g. physiotherapy) and compared to the other intervention alone (200 participants). The interventions were carried out at primary and secondary health care centres. With regard to chronic NP, CBT was statistically significantly better than no treatment at improving pain, disability, and quality of life, but these effects could not be considered clinically meaningful. No differences between CBT and other types of interventions (e.g. medication, education, physiotherapy, manual therapy, and exercises) were found in terms of pain and disability; there was moderate quality evidence that CBT was better than other interventions in improving fear of movement. Also, there was very low quality evidence that CBT added to another intervention was no better at improving pain and disability than the other intervention alone . For subacute NP, there was low quality evidence that CBT was statistically significantly better than other types of interventions (e.g. manual therapy or education) for improving pain, but this effect was not clinically relevant. No difference was found in terms of disability and fear of movement. None of the included studies reported on whether any adverse effects related to cognitive-behavioural therapy were observed. The quality of evidence in this review ranged between “very low” and “moderate”. Therefore, the review results should be interpreted with caution. More high quality randomised trials are needed to address short and long term benefits of cognitive-behavioural therapy in subacute and chronic neck pain, and its effectiveness compared with other treatments, and to better understand which patients may benefit most from this type of intervention."
CD003825,"Nine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of loop diuretics was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mmHg/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2.8) mmHg. Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference. We performed additional searches in 2012 and 2014, which found no additional trials meeting the minimum inclusion criteria. Based on the limited number of published RCTs, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg, which is likely an overestimate. We graded the quality of evidence for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimates as ""low"" due to the high risk of bias of included studies and the high likelihood of publication bias. We found no clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class. The dose-ranging effects of loop diuretics could not be evaluated. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with loop diuretics because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.","We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had addressed these questions. We found 9 trials studying the blood pressure-lowering ability of 5 different loop diuretics (furosemide, cicletanine, piretanide, indacrinone and etozolin) in 460 participants. The blood pressure-lowering effect was modest, with systolic pressure lowered by 8 mmHg and diastolic pressure by 4 mmHg. No loop diuretic drug appears to be any better or worse than others in terms of blood pressure-lowering ability. Due to lack of reporting and the short duration of included trials, this review could not provide an estimate of the harms associated with loop diuretics."
CD003205,"Twenty three randomised controlled trials (1075 participants) were included with a mean treatment duration of 8.9 weeks. The mean dose of omega-3 PUFA used in the trials was 3.5 g/d. No trials with vascular events or mortality endpoints were identified. Among those taking omega-3 PUFA triglyceride levels were significantly lowered by 0.45 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.58 to -0.32, P < 0.00001) and VLDL cholesterol lowered by -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI -0.13 to 0.00, P = 0.04). LDL cholesterol levels were raised by 0.11 mmol/L (95% CI 0.00 to 0.22, P = 0.05). No significant change in or total or HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin or body weight was observed. The increase in VLDL remained significant only in trials of longer duration and in hypertriglyceridemic patients. The elevation in LDL cholesterol was non-significant in subgroup analyses. No adverse effects of the intervention were reported. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation in type 2 diabetes lowers triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol, but may raise LDL cholesterol (although results were non-significant in subgroups) and has no statistically significant effect on glycemic control or fasting insulin. Trials with vascular events or mortality defined endpoints are needed.","We identified 23 randomised trials (maximum duration of eight months) including 1075 people in which omega-3 PUFA was compared to a vegetable oil or placebo. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular endpoints in cardiovascular disease or death as an outcome measure. The review shows that although some types of fat in the blood are reduced through omega-3 supplementation, others including LDL cholesterol (which may promote heart disease) were increased. Control of blood sugar levels was not affected by the treatment. There were no other adverse effects of the interventions noted. Clinical outcome trials of sufficient duration are required to establish conclusively the role of omega-3 PUFA in type 2 diabetes but our results do not suggest a major harmful effect on the balance of blood fats and confirm that it has no adverse affect on blood sugar control."
CD004716,"Four new trials were added after the 2012 search. The review now includes 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants. Overall, the evidence was very low quality. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatments over supportive therapy. These included hospitalisation rates (4 RCTs, n = 306, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.99, very low quality of evidence), clinical improvement in mental state (3 RCTs, n = 194, RR 1.27 CI 1.04 to 1.54, very low quality of evidence) and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care (1 RCT, n = 45, RR 3.19 CI 1.01 to 10.7, very low quality of evidence). For this comparison, we found no evidence of significant differences for rate of relapse, leaving the study early and quality of life. When we compared supportive therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy CBT), we again found no significant differences in primary outcomes. There were very limited data to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation, and no studies provided data regarding clinically important change in general functioning, one of our primary outcomes of interest. There are insufficient data to identify a difference in outcome between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy but these findings are based on a few small studies where we graded the evidence as very low quality. Future research would benefit from larger trials that use supportive therapy as the main treatment arm rather than the comparator.","The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of supportive therapy compared to other specific therapies or treatment as usual. This update is based on a search run in 2012; the review now includes 24 randomised studies with a total of 2126 people. The studies compared supportive therapy either with standard care alone or a range of other therapies such as CBT, family therapy and psychoeducation. The participants continued to receive their antipsychotic medication and any other treatment they would normally receive during the trials. Overall, the quality of evidence from these studies was very low. There is not enough information or data to identify any real therapeutic difference between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation, satisfaction with treatment and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy. However, these findings are limited because they are based on only a few small studies where the quality of evidence is very low. There was very limited information to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation as most studies in this review focused on other psychological therapies, such as CBT. Apart from one study presenting data on death, there was no information on the adverse effects of supportive therapy. In summary, there does not seem to be much difference between supportive therapy, standard care and other therapies. Future research would benefit from larger studies where supportive therapy is the main treatment. Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation: http://mcpin.org/"
CD006345,"The primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and its associated symptoms. No new included studies were identified for this update. One prospective cross-over trial was included in this review. It measured the effect of no compression followed by two phases with different gradients of compression stockings on symptoms in 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time. The included study provided some evidence that compression stockings improved symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, the strength of the evidence in this review is weak as it is based on only one very small trial which was at high risk of bias. The included study did not address any of the secondary outcomes including quality of life or economic impact of the interventions. Nor did the study report the length of time that the population were required to stand at work. Furthermore, no trials were found which measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions or strategies aimed at preventing CVI in standing workers. Due to the extremely limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing CVI in standing workers. Further large-scale studies examining all possible non-pharmacological interventions and outcomes are required.","The trial finding suggested that compression stockings did reduce symptoms associated with CVI including aching of the legs, discomfort, fatigue, swelling and tiredness. However, this evidence was from a very small study. Due to the extremely limited number of trials available, we could not assess the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions in the prevention of this condition. Nor could we ascertain if any intervention had an effect on quality of life or an economic impact such as reducing the number of days of sick leave or work disability. Further research that looks at a broad range of proposed interventions in a clearly defined standing worker population is required."
CD011436,"We included 33 trials with a total of 2293 participants from 0.9 to 12 (mean or median) years of age. Most trials were at low risk of selection, detection, attrition, and reporting bias, however the lack of blinding of participants and personnel caring for participants resulted in 25 trials being judged as at high or unclear risk of bias. We identified five ongoing trials. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the risk of failed block (risk difference (RD) −0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.25 to −0.07; 22 trials; 1789 participants; moderate-quality evidence). When ultrasound guidance was used, there was a small to moderate reduction in pain one hour after surgery, equivalent to a reduction of 1.3 points on the revised Bieri FACES pain scale (scale; 0 = no pain, 10 = maximal pain) (standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.41, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.07 (medium effect size); 15 trials; 982 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Ultrasound guidance increases block duration by the equivalent of 42 minutes (SMD 1.24, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.75; 10 trials; 460 participants; high-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the time taken to perform the block (SMD −0.46, 95% CI −1.06 to 0.13; 9 trials; 680 participants; moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether the number of needle passes required is reduced with the use of ultrasound guidance (SMD −0.63, 95% CI −1.08 to −0.18; 3 trials; 256 participants; very low-quality evidence). There were no occurrences of major complications in either the intervention or control arms of the trials (cardiac arrest from local anaesthetic toxicity (22 trials; 1576 participants; moderate-quality evidence); lasting neurological injury (19 trials; 1250 participants; low-quality evidence)). There may be little of no difference in the risk of bloody puncture (RD −0.02, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.00; 13 trials; 896 participants; low-quality evidence) or transient neurological injury (RD −0.00, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.01; 18 trials; 1230 participants; low-quality evidence). There were no occurrences of seizure from local anaesthetic toxicity (22 trials; 1576 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or block infections without neurological injury (18 trials; 1238 participants; low-quality evidence). Ultrasound guidance for regional blockade in children probably decreases the risk of failed block. It increases the duration of the block and probably decreases pain scores at one hour after surgery. There may be little or no difference in the risks of some minor complications. The five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed.","We included 33 well-designed studies with a total of 2293 children in which ultrasound guidance was compared with another method of nerve localization (traditional landmarks techniques or nerve stimulator) for regional blockade in children. Sources of funding included a government organization (two studies), a charitable organization (two studies), and an institutional department (13 studies). Two studies declared that they received industry help (equipment loan). The source of funding was unclear for 14 studies. Ultrasound guidance for regional blockade in children may decrease the occurrence of failed block. It may also increase duration of the block and reduce pain at one hour after surgery. Ultrasound guidance may decrease the number of needle passes required to perform the block. However, because the vast majority of blocks in children are performed with the child under deep sedation or general anaesthesia, the true value of this finding might be arguable. There were no major complications in the included trials. There may be little or no difference between study groups in risks of minor complications. Altogether, whether or not these findings justify the extra cost of ultrasound guidance should probably also take into account the anaesthesiologist's expertise and local resources. The five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed. We assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate for decreased occurrence of a failed block and improved pain scores at one hour; high for prolonged block duration; and very low for decreased number of needle passes."
CD001925,"Three trials tested aspirin in dosages ranging from 75 mg to 325 mg per day and 125 mg every other day to placebo (in two trials) or control (in one trial) in 1965 AF patients without prior stroke or TIA. The mean duration of follow up averaged 1.3 years per participant. Aspirin was associated with non-significant lower risks of all stroke (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.07), ischemic stroke (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.07), all disabling or fatal stroke (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.49) and all-cause death (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04). The combination of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death was significantly reduced (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97 ). No increase in intracranial hemorrhage or major extracranial hemorrhage was observed. Aspirin appears to reduce stroke and major vascular events in patients with non-valvular AF similar to its effect in other high-risk patients (i.e. by about 25%). For primary prevention among AF patients with an average stroke rate of 4% per year, about 10 strokes would likely be prevented yearly for every 1000 AF patients given aspirin.","Antiplatelet agents like aspirin are effective for preventing serious vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation not suitable for oral anticoagulants. Atrial fibrillation is an irregularity of the heartbeat that leads to blood clots forming in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). These clots can break free and travel through the bloodstream to the brain and cause a stroke. Drugs that slow clotting, such as antiplatelet agents (aspirin and others) and anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this review the benefits of antiplatelet agents are shown to be modest (nearly 25% decrease in stroke), but they are relatively safe, easy to take, and therefore an important treatment option for many atrial fibrillation patients. Anticoagulation with warfarin and related drugs offers more protection against stroke (nearly two-thirds reduction), but anticoagulant drugs can cause severe bleeding and require careful regulation with regular blood tests. The choice of antiplatelet drugs versus anticoagulants should be individualized based on the patient's inherent risk of stroke, ability to tolerate anticoagulation without bleeding, access to adequate anticoagulation monitoring, and patient preferences."
CD000256,"Forty-one trials involving over 5000 patients were included. Variation in study design and quality made synthesis of the data problematic. Allocation concealment was adequate in only two trials. Most data were from areas of multidrug resistant falciparum malaria in South-East Asia. Compared with standard antimalarial treatments, artemisinin drugs showed fast parasite clearance and high cure rates at follow-up, provided the duration of treatment with artemisinin drugs was adequate. Combination with mefloquine improved sustained parasite clearance and was effective in multidrug resistant areas. When doses were adequate, the combination shortened the duration of treatment. We found no evidence that artemisinin drugs are more harmful than standard treatment drugs over a typical trial period of 28 days. The evidence suggests that artemisinin drugs are effective and safe for treating uncomplicated malaria. There is no evidence from randomised trials that one artemisinin derivative is better than the others. In areas where there is mefloquine resistance, combination therapy with an artemisinin derivative appears to improve sustained parasite clearance compared with either drug alone. This review summarizes trials up to 1999. For the reasons in the 'What's new' section, this review will no longer be updated.","The review shows that artemisinin drugs clear malaria parasites from the blood more effectively than standard treatment drugs. In areas where malaria parasites are more resistant to existing drugs, such as South-East Asia, artemisinin drugs are not better at sustained parasite clearance than standard treatment with quinine or mefloquine. Combination treatment using an artemisinin drug together with the longer-acting antimalarial drug mefloquine improves sustained clearance of parasites, but mefloquine is associated with adverse effects. There are few studies on combination treatment with longer-acting antimalarial drugs that are safer than mefloquine. There is no evidence from trials that any of the several artemisinin derivatives is better than the others."
